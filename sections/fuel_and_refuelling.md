## Fuel Specifications

### Fuel Type Requirements

- **Petrol**: 95-98 RON (Research Octane Number)
- **Tank Capacity**: 70 litres (15.4 gallons) usable capacity

### MTBE (Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether)

Unleaded fuel containing an oxygenate known as MTBE can be used provided that the ratio of MTBE to conventional fuel does not exceed **15%**.

MTBE is an ether-based compound derived from petroleum, which has been specified by several refiners as the substance to enhance the octane rating of fuel.

## Fuel Filler Operations

### Fuel Filler Flap Access

**Important**: The vehicle must be unlocked using the Smart key before the filler flap can be opened.

#### Step-by-Step Procedure

1. **Press and release** the flap (in the area indicated) to unlatch
2. **Pull the flap open** - The label on the inside indicates the correct fuel for the vehicle
3. **Twist the cap counter-clockwise** to undo
4. **Stow the cap** on the lip provided, on top of the hinge arm

#### Closing the Filler Flap

- **Replace the cap**: Turn clockwise until the ratchet clicks
- **Close the flap**: Push until latched closed
- **Locking**: The filler flap will only be locked closed when the vehicle is centrally locked

**Warning**: Failure to properly secure the cap may cause the engine malfunction warning lamp to illuminate.

### Fuel Filling Procedures

#### Safety Precautions

- **Do not attempt** to fill the tank to its maximum capacity
- **Avoid parking** on slopes, in direct sunlight, or high ambient temperature (fuel expansion may cause spillage)
- **Check fuel pump information** carefully to ensure correct fuel type
- **Seek qualified assistance** immediately if incorrect fuel is used

#### Filling Process

1. **Insert nozzle fully** into the filler neck
2. **Fill slowly** until automatic cut-off
3. **Do not attempt** to fill beyond the automatic cut-off point
4. **Fuel station pumps** are equipped with automatic cut-off sensing to prevent spillage

## Emergency Procedures

### Running Out of Fuel

**Avoid running out of fuel!**

If the vehicle does run out of fuel:

- **Minimum requirement**: 4 litres (0.9 gallons) to restart the engine
- **Wait time**: Leave ignition on for 5 minutes after refuelling before attempting to restart
- **Recommendation**: Seek qualified assistance if fuel starvation occurs

## Fuel Consumption

### Consumption Figures

The following figures are calculated using the standard EC test procedure (Directive 99/100/EC) and produced in accordance with The Passenger Car Fuel Consumption (Amendment) Order 1996.

**Note**: Actual consumption may differ based on driving technique, road conditions, environmental factors, vehicle load, and condition.

#### Fuel Consumption Data

| Variant                                       | COâ‚‚ Emissions (g/km) | Combined l/100km (mpg) | Extra-urban l/100km (mpg) | Urban l/100km (mpg) |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **3.0L (340 ps) with Intelligent stop/start** | 205.0                | 8.0 (32.1)             | 6.0 (41.5)                | 12.0 (22.8)         |
| **3.0L (380 ps) with Intelligent stop/start** | 213.0                | 9.0 (31.0)             | 7.0 (40.4)                | 12.0 (22.0)         |

| **3.0L without Intelligent stop/start**       | 234.0                | 10.0 (28.3)            | 7.0 (39.2)                | 14.0 (19.1)         |
| **5.0L without Intelligent stop/start**       | 278.0                | 11.0 (23.7)            | 8.0 (32.5)                | 17.0 (16.1)         |

### Test Cycle Explanations

#### Urban Cycle

- **Test conditions**: Cold start with accelerations, decelerations, steady speed, and idling
- **Maximum speed**: 50 km/h (30 mph)
- **Average speed**: 19 km/h (12 mph)

#### Extra-urban Cycle

- **Test conditions**: Immediately after urban test, half steady-speed driving, half accelerations/decelerations
- **Maximum speed**: 120 km/h (75 mph)
- **Average speed**: 63 km/h (39 mph)
- **Test distance**: 7 km (4.3 miles)

#### Combined Figure

The combined figure is a weighted average of urban and extra-urban test results, accounting for the different distances covered during the two tests.

## Safety Warnings

### Parts and Accessories

- **Do not fit** non-approved parts and accessories
- **Do not carry out** non-approved alterations or conversions
- **Roof racks**: Your vehicle is not designed for roof rack use - damage may result

### Airbag System

The airbag system components are sensitive to electrical or physical interference, which could damage the system and cause inadvertent operation or malfunction.

**Always consult your Dealer/Authorised Repairer before fitting:**

- Electronic equipment (mobile phones, two-way radios, entertainment systems)
- Accessories attached to the front of the vehicle
- Any modification to the front of the vehicle
- Any modification involving wiring or components near airbag system parts
- Any modification to fascia panels or steering wheel

### Anti-theft System

- **No modifications** should be made to the anti-theft system
- Such changes could cause system malfunction

## Running-in Procedures

### Overview

This vehicle is built using high-precision manufacturing methods, but engine moving parts must still bed-in relative to one another. The process occurs mainly in the first **3,000 km (2,000 miles)** of operation.

### General Running-in Guidelines (0-3,000 km)

During the running-in period, you should:

- **Avoid** frequent cold starts followed by short-distance driving
- **Preferably** take longer trips
- **Do not use** full throttle during starts and normal driving
- **Avoid** continuous operation at high engine speed and abrupt stops
- **Do not participate** in track days, sports driving schools, or similar activities

### Specific Speed Limits

#### First 2,000 km (1,200 miles)

- Drive at varying engine and road speeds
- **Do not exceed**: 4,000 rpm and 170 km/h (105 mph)

#### 2,000-3,000 km (1,200-2,000 miles)

- Engine and road speeds can be increased gradually
- Engine speeds in excess of 5,000 rpm should only be used briefly (e.g., when overtaking)

### General Engine Care

**At all times** (not just during running-in):

- **Do not exceed** 4,000 rpm until the engine has reached full operating temperature
- **Avoid laboring** the engine by operating in too high a gear at low speeds
