check and top-up the brake fluid, or allow the
brakes to cool, if necessary. If the lamp remains
illuminated, seek qualified assistance before
continuing.
BRAKE (YELLOW)
Illuminates with a message, to
indicate worn brake components.
The messages that may appear in the Message
centre are:
•
All vehicles: Brake Pads Worn.
•
Vehicles with carbon ceramic brakes:
Carbon Ceramic Brake Discs Worn.
When a message is displayed, drive carefully
and seek qualified assistance at the earliest
opportunity.
Note: If the lamp illuminates without a message,
then a fault has been detected with the brake
wear system. Drive carefully and seek qualified
assistance at the earliest opportunity.
PARKING BRAKE (RED)
Illuminates when the Parking brake
is correctly applied. If the lamp
flashes, a fault has been detected.
Seek qualified assistance urgently.

and an occupied front seat belt is
unbuckled. The lamp will extinguish
when the relevant seat belt(s) is
buckled.

activate the Seat belt reminder. It is
recommended that any objects placed on the
front passenger seat are secured using the seat
belt. See 24, USING THE SEAT BELTS.
ANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM (ABS)
(AMBER)
If the ABS and brake warning lamps
are illuminated at the same time, do
not drive the vehicle until the fault is
rectified. Seek qualified assistance
immediately.
Illuminates briefly, as a bulb check,
when the ignition is switched on.
If the lamp remains on or illuminates whilst
driving, there is a fault with the ABS system.
Drive with care, avoiding heavy brake
application and seek qualified assistance
urgently.

Warning lamps

ENGINE/TRANSMISSION (AMBER)
Illuminates briefly, as a bulb check,
when the ignition is switched on. If
the lamp illuminates when the
engine is running, there is an
emissions-related fault with the
engine or transmission. The vehicle
can be driven but may enter
Limp-home mode with the
possibility of reduced performance.
Seek qualified assistance as soon as
possible.
If the warning lamp flashes while the engine is
running, reduce speed and seek qualified
assistance urgently.
DYNAMIC STABILITY CONTROL (DSC)
(AMBER)
Illuminates briefly, as a bulb check,
when the ignition is switched on.

Warning lamps

LIGHTING CONTROL

1. With the headlamps on, push the switch
   away from the steering wheel to select high
   beam. The blue warning indicator in the
   Instrument panel will illuminate.
   Note: Do not use high beam where it may
   distract other road users.
2. Pull the switch towards the steering wheel
   and release to flash the high beam on and
   off. The high beam will remain on for as
   long as the switch is held.
3. Side lamps.
4. Low beam.
5. AUTO: When ambient light fades, the side
   lamps and headlamps will switch on
   automatically.
6. Exit delay of 30 seconds.
7. Exit delay of 60 seconds.
8. Exit delay of 120 seconds.
   Note: If the rotary control is in the AUTO
   position, there will be no exit delay and the
   headlamps will extinguish when the ignition
   system is turned off.
   Press the headlamp button on the Smart key to
   switch off the headlamps during an exit delay
   period.
   If the rotary control is moved to the OFF
   position, with high beam still activated, both
   low and high beam will be extinguished. Both
   low and high beam will illuminate when the
   headlamps are turned on again.
   The rear fog lamp switch is located on the
   driver's side lower fascia. See 234, DRIVER
   CONTROLS.

   Exterior lights

Press to switch the rear fog lamps on/off. They
will only operate while side lamps, headlamps,
or Auto lamps are selected. The warning lamp
will illuminate. See 40, REAR FOG LAMP
(AMBER).
DAYTIME RUNNING LAMPS
In some countries, with the rotary control in the
OFF or AUTO position, low beam headlamps,
side lamps, tail, number plate lamps and, where
fitted, side marker lamps will switch on
automatically with the following conditions:
•
The ignition is on.
•
The Parking brake is not applied (is
released) - market dependent.
APPROACH LAMPS
The headlamps can be illuminated remotely for
a programmed length of time, by pressing the
headlamp button on the Smart key. See 6,
UNLOCKING THE VEHICLE. Press the button
again to switch off.
Note: In some markets, a second press will
illuminate the reverse lamps and a third press
is required to turn the lamps off.
ADAPTIVE FRONT LIGHTING SYSTEM
(AFS)
The Adaptive Front Lighting System is designed
to give the driver improved visibility, using a
swivelling headlamp unit, a static bending lamp,
and a cornering lamp. These lamps broaden the
beam of the headlamps when cornering in
different circumstances.
The headlamp unit swivels accordingly when
cornering, to improve light spread on bends in
the road.
Static bending lamps: The static bending lamps
operate when necessary, to provide an even
broader light spread.
Cornering lamps: At speeds of up to 40 km/h
(25 mph), to provide improved visibility at
junctions, the system switches on the lamp if
it has received an input from the vehicle's
direction indicator. Only the lamp on the same
side as the operating indicator illuminates. The
lamp will self cancel after 3 minutes of
continuous operation.
WINDSCREEN WIPER DETECTION
This function only operates when AUTO is
selected. The side lamps, tail lamps, and
headlamps will switch on automatically if the
windscreen wipers are operated for more than
20 wipes. Once the windscreen wipers are
switched off, the side lamps and headlamps will
automatically switch off 2 minutes later.
HIGH BEAM ASSIST
This feature automatically selects and deselects
high beam, under specific conditions of road
lighting and in the absence of other vehicle’s
lights. The system is only active when the
ambient light drops below a predetermined
level.
This function is only active if the rotary control
is in the AUTO position and the lighting control
is in the central position.
The system will only activate when the vehicle's
speed exceeds 40 km/h (25 mph). The system
will deactivate when the vehicle's speed drops
below 24 km/h (15 mph).
Note: High beam assist does not operate when
Reverse (R) gear is selected.
To manually select high beam, move the lighting
control to the high beam position as normal. To
return to High beam assist, move the lighting
control back to the central position.
