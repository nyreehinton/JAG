# Seat belts

Note: The indicators will be displayed for
seconds each time there is a status change, e.g.,
a seat belt is unfastened or fastened, or a door
is opened and then closed.
In addition, an audible warning will sound under
the following conditions:
•
The driver’s or occupied passenger’s seat
belt is not fastened or is unfastened during
a journey.
Note: If a heavy object is placed on the
passenger seat, it may activate the Seat belt
reminder feature. It is recommended that the
object be placed in the Luggage compartment
or secured using the seat belt.

CHILD SEATS
If it is essential that a child travels in
the front, set the vehicle seat fully
rearward, fully raised and seat the
child in an approved forward-facing
child seat. Do not use a rear-facing
child seat - an inflating airbag could
impact with the seat and cause serious
injury.
Do not use a forward-facing child seat
until the child using it is above the
minimum weight of 9 kg (20 lb) and
able to sit up unaided. Up to the age
of two, a child's spine and neck are not
sufficiently developed to avoid injury
in a frontal impact.
Do not allow a baby or infant to be held
or carried on the lap. The force of a
crash can increase effective body
weight by as much as thirty times,
making it impossible to hold onto the
child.
Children typically require the use of a
booster seat appropriate to their age
and size, thereby enabling the seat
belts to be properly fitted, reducing the
risk of injury in a crash. Children could
be endangered in a crash if their child
restraints are not properly secured in
the vehicle.
Do not use a child seat that hooks over
the seatback. This type of seat cannot
be satisfactorily secured and is unlikely
to be safe for your child.
The seat belts fitted to your vehicle are designed
for adults and larger children. It is very
important for all infants and children under
years of age to be restrained in a suitable child
safety seat appropriate to their age and size.
If it is essential that a child travels in the front
passenger seat (and if national legislation
permits this), Jaguar recommends that the
following preparations are made before fitting
the child restraint.
•
Disable the front passenger airbag. See 33,
DISABLING THE PASSENGER AIRBAG.
•
Adjust the front passenger seat fully
rearwards.
•
Adjust the lumbar support to its minimum
support position.
•
Adjust the seat cushion to its highest
position. If cushion front tilt adjustment is
possible, adjust it to its lowest position.
•
Adjust the seatback to the fully upright
position.
Extreme hazard! Do not use a rearward
facing child restraint on a seat
protected by an airbag in front of it!
The symbol above, affixed to the front door post
on the passenger side, and the label below,
affixed to the sun visor, warn against the use
of a rear-facing child seat in the front passenger
seat, when a front passenger airbag is fitted and
operational.
