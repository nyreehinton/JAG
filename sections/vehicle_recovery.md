# Vehicle recovery

BEFORE STARTING OR DRIVING
If the vehicle is involved in a collision,
it should be checked by a Dealer/
Authorised repairer, or suitably
qualified personnel, before starting or
driving.
PEDESTRIAN PROTECTION SYSTEM
The bumper includes sensors that detect a
collision with a pedestrian and includes energy
absorbing foam and plastics in its construction,
to reduce leg injuries.
During a pedestrian collision, the sensors
initiate a bonnet deployment system that
releases the bonnet latches and raises the rear
edge of the bonnet by approximately 130 mm
(5.1 inches).
This increases the gap between the bonnet and
the components within the engine compartment
to create a cushion to mitigate injury caused to
the pedestrian.
The bonnet deployment system is active only
when the ignition is on and the vehicle is driven
between the speeds of approximately 20 km/h
(12 mph) and 50 km/h (31 mph).
AFTER DEPLOYMENT OF THE
PEDESTRIAN PROTECTION SYSTEM
Do not attempt to open the bonnet if the
Pedestrian protection system has been
deployed.
The vehicle must be stopped as soon as it is
safe to do so.
The hazard warning lamps will be activated and
can only be switched off by pressing the engine
START/STOP button to turn the engine off and
on again.
A warning message CHECK PEDESTRIAN
SYSTEM will appear in the Message centre and
the vehicle should be transported to the nearest
Dealer/Authorised Repairer. The vehicle must
not be driven when the bonnet has been
deployed.
Note: If the warning message CHECK
PEDESTRIAN SYSTEM appears in the Message
centre when the bonnet has not been deployed,
the vehicle should be taken to the nearest
Dealer/Authorised Repairer immediately. It can
be driven.
If any significant damage occurs to the front
bumper it should be inspected by a
Dealer/Authorised Repairer as soon as possible.
SERVICE DATA RECORDING
Service data recorders in your vehicle are
capable of collecting and storing diagnostic
information about your vehicle. This potentially
includes information about the performance or
status of various systems and modules in the
vehicle, such as engine, throttle, steering, or
brakes.
In order to properly diagnose and service your
vehicle, Jaguar Land Rover Limited service and
repair facilities may access vehicle diagnostic
information through a direct connection to your
vehicle.
