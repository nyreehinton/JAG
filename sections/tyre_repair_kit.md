# Tyre repair kit

Only use the tyre repair kit for the
vehicle with which it was supplied.
Do not use the tyre repair kit for any
other purpose than tyre repair.
Never leave the tyre repair kit
unattended, when in use.
Only use the tyre repair kit within the

- 30°C to +70°C temperature range.
  Always keep children and animals at
  a safe distance from the tyre repair kit,
  when in use.
  Do not stand directly beside the
  compressor when it is operating.
  Check the tyre sidewall prior to
  inflation. If any cracks, damage, or
  deformities are apparent, do not inflate
  the tyre.
  Watch the tyre sidewall during
  inflation. If any cracks, bumps, or
  similar damage, or deformities appear,
  switch off the compressor and deflate
  the tyre.
  USING THE TYRE REPAIR KIT
  Avoid skin contact with the sealant
  which contains natural rubber latex.
  If the tyre inflation pressure does not
  reach 1.8 bar (26 psi, 180 kPa) within
  a maximum of 10 minutes, the tyre
  may have suffered excessive damage.
  A temporary repair will not be
  possible, and the vehicle should not
  be driven until the tyre has been
  replaced.
  Before attempting a tyre repair, make
  sure that the vehicle is parked safely, as
  far away from passing traffic as possible.
  Make sure that the Parking brake is
  applied and P (Park) is selected.
  Do not attempt to remove foreign
  objects, such as nails, screws, etc. from
  the tyre.
  Never start the engine and leave it
  running when the vehicle is in an
  enclosed space. Exhaust gases are
  poisonous and cause unconsciousness
  and death, if inhaled.
  To prevent overheating, do not operate
  the compressor continuously for longer
  than 10 minutes.
  Note: All vehicle drivers and occupants should
  be made aware that a temporary repair has been
  made to a tyre fitted to the vehicle. They should
  also be made aware of the special driving
  conditions imposed when using a repaired tyre.
  REPAIR PROCEDURE
  Check the tyre sidewall prior to
  inflation. If there are any cracks,
  bumps, or similar damage, do not
  attempt to inflate the tyre. Do not stand
  directly beside the tyre while the
  compressor is pumping. Watch the tyre
  sidewall. If any cracks, bumps, or
  similar damage appear, turn off the
  compressor and let the air out by
  means of the pressure relief valve. Do
  not continue to use the tyre.
  If the tyre inflation pressure does not
  reach 1.8 bar (26 psi, 180 kPa) within
  a maximum of 10 minutes, the tyre
  may have suffered excessive damage.
  A temporary repair will not be
  possible, and the vehicle should not
  be driven until the tyre has been
  replaced.

  Tyre repair kit

1. Open the tyre repair kit and peel off the
   maximum speed label. Attach the label to
   the fascia, in the driver's field of vision. Take
   care not to obstruct any of the instruments
   or warning lamps.
2. Uncoil the compressor power cable and the
   inflation hose.
3. Unscrew the orange cap from the sealant
   bottle receiver and the sealant bottle cap.
4. Screw the sealant bottle into the receiver
   (clockwise) until tight.
   Note: Screwing the bottle onto the receiver
   will pierce the bottle's seal. Once the
   receiver has been fitted, a ratchet prevents
   it from being removed.
5. Remove the valve cap from the damaged
   tyre.
6. Remove the protective cap from the inflation
   hose. Connect the inflation hose to the tyre
   valve making sure that the hose is screwed
   on firmly.
7. Making sure that the compressor switch is
   in the Off (0) position, insert the power
   cable connector into an auxiliary power
   socket. See 234, DRIVER CONTROLS.
   Then switch on the ignition. See 73,
   SWITCHING ON THE IGNITION.
8. Switch on the compressor by positioning
   the switch to the (l) position.
9. Inflate the tyre to a minimum of 1.8 bar (26
   psi, 180 kPa) and a maximum of 3.5 bar
   (51 psi, 350 kPa).
   Note: When pumping the sealant through
   the tyre valve, the pressure may rise up to
   6 bar (87 psi, 600 kPa). The pressure will
   drop again after approximately 30 seconds.
10. During the inflation, switch the compressor
    off briefly, to check the tyre pressure using
    the gauge mounted on the compressor.
    Note: It should not take longer than
    minutes to inflate the tyre. If, after a
    maximum of 10 minutes, the tyre has not
    yet reached minimum pressure, the tyre
    should not be used.
11. Once the tyre has been inflated to the
    required pressure, switch off the
    compressor. If desired, the ignition may be
    turned off after the compressor has been
    turned off.
12. Remove the power connector from the
    auxiliary power socket.
13. Remove the inflation hose from the tyre
    valve, by unscrewing it as quickly as
    possible (counter-clockwise).
14. Replace the inflation hose protective cap
    and the tyre valve cap.
15. Make sure that the tyre repair kit (including
    the bottle and receiver caps) are placed
    securely in the vehicle. You will need to use
    the kit to check the tyre pressure after a
    maximum of 10 km (6 miles), so make sure
    that they are easily accessible.
16. Immediately drive the vehicle for a
    maximum of 10 km (6 miles), to allow the
    sealant to coat the inner surface of the tyre
    and form a seal at the puncture.
    CHECKING THE TYRE PRESSURE
    AFTER A REPAIR
    When driving the vehicle, if you
    experience vibrations, abnormal
    steering, or noises, reduce speed
    immediately. Drive with extreme
    caution and reduced speed, to the first
    safe place to stop the vehicle. Visually
    examine the tyre and check its
    pressure. If there are any signs of
    damage or deformity to the tyre, or the
    tyre pressure is below 1.3 bar (19 psi,
    130 kPa), do not continue driving.

    Tyre repair kit

Consult a tyre repair centre or a
Dealer/Authorised Repairer, for advice
concerning the replacement of a tyre
after using a tyre repair kit.

1. Drive the vehicle for a maximum of 10 km
   (6 miles) then stop in a safe place. Carry
   out a visual examination of the tyre’s
   condition.
2. Remove the repair kit from the vehicle.
3. Screw the inflation hose connector firmly
   onto the tyre valve.
4. Read the tyre pressure from the gauge.
5. If the pressure of the sealant filled tyre is
   above 1.3 bar (19 psi, 130 kPa), adjust the
   pressure to the correct value.
6. Make sure that the compressor switch is in
   the off (O) position and insert the power
   cable connector into the auxiliary power
   socket.
   Then switch on the ignition.
7. Switch the compressor to on (I) and inflate
   the tyre to the correct pressure. See 177,
   TYRE PRESSURES.
8. To check the tyre pressure, turn off the
   compressor and then read the pressure
   from the gauge.
9. When the compressor is off, if the tyre
   pressure is too high, release the required
   amount of pressure using the pressure
   release valve.
10. Once the tyre is inflated to the correct
    pressure, switch off the compressor and
    remove the power plug from the auxiliary
    socket.
    Note: The use of the tyre repair kit sealant
    may lead to error prompts and incorrect
    readings of the Tyre Pressure Monitoring
    System (TPMS); therefore, use the tyre
    repair kit pressure gauge to check and
    adjust the damaged tyre's inflation pressure.
11. Unscrew the inflation hose connector from
    the tyre valve, replace the tyre valve cap and
    the inflation hose connector protective cap.
12. Make sure that the tyre repair kit is placed
    securely in the vehicle.
13. Drive to the nearest tyre repair centre or
    Dealer/Authorised Repairer, for a
    replacement tyre to be fitted. Make sure that
    you inform the repair centre that the tyre
    repair kit has been used before the tyre is
    removed.
14. The tyre inflation hose, the receiver, and the
    sealant bottle must be replaced once a new
    tyre has been fitted.
    Only sealant bottles which are
    completely empty should be
    disposed of with normal household
    waste. Sealant bottles which contain
    some sealant, and the tyre inflation
    hose, should be disposed of by a
    tyre specialist or your
    Dealer/Authorised Repairer in
    compliance with local waste disposal
    regulations.

WHEEL CHANGING SAFETY
Before raising the vehicle, or changing a wheel,
make sure that you read, and comply with the
following warnings.
Always find a safe place to stop, off the
road and away from traffic.
Make sure that the vehicle and jack are
both on firm, level ground.
Apply the Parking brake and engage
Park (P).
Switch on the hazard warning lamps.
Make sure that the front wheels are in
the straight ahead position, and
engage the steering lock.
Make sure that all passengers, and
animals, are out of the vehicle and in
a safe place away from the road.
Place a warning triangle at a suitable
distance behind the vehicle, facing
towards oncoming traffic.
When one rear wheel is lifted off of the
ground, the selection of Park (P) will
not prevent the vehicle from moving
and possibly slipping off of the jack,
as the Parking brake only operates on
the rear wheels.
Always chock the wheel diagonally
opposite the wheel to be changed,
using the wheel chock supplied in the
tool kit. Chock the front of a front
wheel, or the rear of a rear wheel.
If jacking the vehicle on a slight slope
is unavoidable, place the chocks on
the downhill side of the two opposite
wheels. An additional chock will be
needed.
Never place anything between the jack
and the ground, or the jack and the
vehicle.
Do not attempt to raise the vehicle
unless the jack head is fully engaged
in the jacking point. Only jack the
vehicle using the approved jacking
points.
Remove the spare wheel prior to
jacking the vehicle, to avoid
destabilising the vehicle when raised.
Take care when lifting the spare wheel,
and removing the punctured wheel.
The wheels are heavy and can cause
injuries if not handled correctly.
Do not start or run the engine while the
vehicle is supported only by a jack.
WARNING - THAT NO PERSON SHOULD
PLACE ANY PORTION OF THEIR BODY
UNDER A VEHICLE THAT IS
SUPPORTED BY A JACK.
Take care when loosening the wheel
nuts. The wheel brace may slip off if
not properly attached, and the wheel
nuts may release suddenly. Either
unexpected movement may cause an
injury.
After use, the tool kit should be
returned to the under floor storage area
and correctly stowed.
Always make sure replacement tyres
have the correct rating and
specifications (e.g., load index, size,
speed rating) for your vehicle.
