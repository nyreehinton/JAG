# Vehicle cleaning

ENGINE COMPARTMENT
Do not use a high pressure washer or
steam cleaner in the engine
compartment.
Make sure that the brake fluid reservoir
is kept dry at all times. Only use a clean,
dry cloth to clean the brake fluid cap and
reservoir.
GLASS SURFACES
Clean the rear window with a soft cloth to avoid
damaging the heating element. Do not scrape
the glass or use any abrasive cleaning fluid.
Mirror glass is particularly susceptible to
damage. Wash with soapy water. Do not use
abrasive cleaning compounds or metal scrapers
to remove ice.
REAR SCREEN
To avoid damaging the heating elements when
cleaning the inside of the rear screen, use only
a soft, damp cloth or chamois leather. Do not
use solvents or sharp objects to clean the glass.
REMOVING GREASE AND TAR
Remove grease or tar with Jaguar Tar Remover
or methylated spirit (alcohol). White spirit is
also effective, but must not be applied to rubber,
particularly the windscreen wiper blades.
Make sure that after using methylated
or white spirit, the area is washed
immediately with soapy water, to remove
all traces of spirit.
POLISHING
Chrome polish, or other abrasive
cleaners, must not be used on the
vehicle's brightwork.
It is recommended that the vehicle is polished
regularly using Jaguar polish and a polishing
cloth.
THE INTERIOR
The steering wheel centre pad, and other
areas containing airbags, should only be
cleaned sparingly with a damp cloth,
warm water, and a non-detergent soap.
LEATHER UPHOLSTERY
To prevent ingrained dirt and staining, inspect
the seat upholstery regularly and clean every
one to two months, as follows:
•
Wipe off fine dust from the seat surfaces
using a clean, damp, non-coloured cloth.
Change frequently to a clean area of cloth,
to avoid abrasive action on the leather
surface. Avoid over-wetting.
•
If this is not sufficient, use a cloth which
has been dampened with warm soapy water
and then wrung out. Use only mild
non-caustic soap.
•
Use Jaguar Leather Cleaner for heavily
soiled areas. Dry off and rub with a clean
soft cloth, changing surfaces regularly.
Use Jaguar Leather Cleaner several times a year
to maintain its appearance and suppleness. The
cleaner will nourish and moisturise, and help
to improve the surface's protective film against
dust and substances.
•
Do not use solvents. Do not use detergents,
furniture polish, or household cleaners.
While these products may initially give
impressive results, their use will lead to
rapid deterioration of the leather and will
invalidate the warranty. Jaguar recommend
a basic set of products that have been
specially selected for the type of leather in
your vehicle.

Vehicle cleaning

•
Dark clothing may stain leather seats, just
like other upholstery products.
•
Sharp objects, such as belts, zip fasteners,
rivets, etc., can leave permanent scratches
and scratch marks on the leather surface.
•
Unless spillages, such as tea, coffee, or ink
are washed away immediately, permanent
staining may have to be accepted.
If a valet service is used, make sure that the
specialist concerned is aware of, and follows,
these instructions precisely.
FABRIC UPHOLSTERY
Never use soap, ammonia, bleach, or
other cleaners intended for use on hard
surfaces.
Do not use upholstery cleaner on
electrical equipment such as fascia
switches.
When cleaning around electrical
equipment, such as switches, make sure
that fluids do not leak into any gaps
around the components or between
panels or trim.
Use Jaguar Upholstery Cleaner, following the
instructions. Avoid over-wetting.
REMOVING STAINS
Most stains on woollen fabric can be removed
if treatment is carried out immediately, before
the stain has a chance to dry-in.
Most stains can be treated with one of three
cleaning fluids: Jaguar Upholstery Cleaner, dry
cleaning fluid, or clean water. Follow the
instructions on the package.
INSTRUMENT PANEL, TOUCH SCREEN
AND AUDIO SYSTEM
Only use a soft, dry cloth to clean the
Instrument panel, clock, and audio equipment.
Do not use cleaning fluids or sprays.
CARPET AND MATS
Marks or stains can be removed by gentle
scrubbing with a weak solution of soap and
warm water.
For more stubborn stains, a commercially
available carpet cleaner should be used.
SEAT BELTS
Do not allow any water, cleaning
products, or fabric from cloths to enter
the seat belt mechanism. Any
substance which enters the mechanism
may affect the performance of the seat
belt in an impact.
Extend the seat belts fully, then use warm water
and a non-detergent soap to clean. Allow the
seat belts to dry naturally while fully extended,
and do not allow the belts to retract until fully
dry.
Note: While cleaning the seat belt, take the
opportunity to examine the webbing for damage
and wear. Any wear or damage should be
reported to, and rectified by, a Dealer/
Authorised Repairer.
AIRBAG MODULE COVERS
Airbag covers should only be cleaned
using a slightly dampened cloth and a
small amount of upholstery cleaner.
Any substance which enters the
mechanism, can prevent correct
deployment of an airbag during an
impact.

FLUID FILLER LOCATIONS
Note: The brake fluid reservoirs, for both the
left and right-hand drive vehicles are located
underneath an access cover. See 145, UNDER
BONNET COVERS - REMOVAL.

1. Brake reservoir (right-hand drive vehicles).
2. Brake reservoir (left-hand drive vehicles).
3. Engine oil.
4. Power steering reservoir.
5. Coolant reservoir (expansion tank).
6. Washer fluid reservoir.
   Do not drive the vehicle if there is a
   possibility that leaked fluid will come
   into contact with a hot surface, such
   as the exhaust.
   While working in the engine
   compartment, always observe the
   safety precautions. See 143, SAFETY
   IN THE GARAGE.
   CHECKING THE ENGINE OIL LEVEL
   The engine oil level is not monitored when the
   engine is running and/or the vehicle is in
   motion.

   Fluid level checks

The engine oil should be checked frequently and
topped up as required using the correct grade
for the engine.
Check the engine oil weekly. If any
significant or sudden drop in oil level is
noted, seek qualified assistance.
If the message ENGINE OIL PRESSURE
LOW is displayed, stop the engine as
soon as it is safe to do so, and seek
qualified assistance. Do not start the
engine until the cause has been rectified.
Prior to checking the oil level, make sure that
the vehicle is on level ground.
•
The engine oil has reached working
temperature (oil is hot).
•
The engine has been switched off for
minutes, as the system will not give an
accurate reading until the oil level has
stabilised.
The oil level can then be checked as follows:

1. Switch on the ignition (do not start the
   engine).
2. Make sure Park (P) is selected.
3. Select the Service menu using the
   Instrument panel menu control (see 35,
   INSTRUMENT PANEL MENU).
   Select Oil level display from the Service
   menu. The current oil level status and
   topping up advice is displayed in the
   Instrument panel, top up as instructed.
   An indication of the oil level is displayed in the
   gauge. Messages to the right of the gauge
   advise you of any action you may need to take.
   If the oil level is within the required operating
   range, the message Engine Oil Level OK will
   be displayed. Do not add any additional oil to
   the engine.
   If the oil level is below the required operating
   range, a message advising you of how much
   oil to add will be displayed (e.g., Add 0.5 Litre).
   Add the recommended quantity of oil.
   If the message Engine Oil Level Overfilled is
   displayed, seek qualified assistance
   immediately. Do not drive the vehicle as this
   will cause serious damage to the engine.
   If the message Engine Oil Level Underfilled is
   displayed, add 1.5 litres (2.6 pints) of oil, then
   recheck the level.
   If the message Engine Oil Level Not Available
   is displayed, the oil level is stabilising. Switch
   off the ignition, wait for 10 minutes, then
   recheck the oil level display.
   If the warning message ENGINE OIL LEVEL
   MONITOR SYSTEM FAULT is displayed, seek
   qualified assistance.
   Note: If it is necessary to check the oil level
   when the engine is hot, switch off the engine
   and let it stand for 5 minutes to allow the oil to
   drain into the sump. Do not start the engine.
   TOPPING UP THE OIL
   Failure to use an oil that meets the
   required specification could cause
   excessive engine wear, a build up of
   sludge and deposits, and increase
   pollution. It could also lead to engine
   failure. Do not use low quality or
   obsolete oils.
   Your vehicle warranty may be invalidated
   if damage is caused by using oil that
   does not meet the required specification.

   Fluid level checks

Overfilling with oil could result in severe
engine damage. Oil should be added in
small quantities and the level rechecked
to make sure that the engine is not
overfilled.
Do not use oil additives of any type, as
engine damage could occur. Use only
specified lubricants.

1. Unscrew the oil filler cap.
2. Add oil, as indicated by the Message centre
   display.
3. Wait 5 minutes for the oil level to stabilise
   and then recheck.
   It is essential to use the correct specification
   oil, and to make sure it is suitable for the
   climatic conditions in which the vehicle is to be
   operated, see 201, LUBRICANTS AND FLUIDS.

   CHECKING THE COOLANT LEVEL
   Running the engine without coolant will
   cause serious engine damage.
   If persistent coolant loss is noticed, seek
   qualified assistance immediately.
   The coolant level in the expansion tank should
   be checked at least weekly (more frequently in
   high mileage or severe operating conditions).
   Always check the level when the system is cold.
   Make sure the coolant level is maintained
   between the maximum and minimum level
   indicator marks, as illustrated.
   If the message LOW COOLANT LEVEL is
   displayed in the Message centre, stop the
   vehicle as soon as safety permits and top up
   the coolant reservoir with the recommended
   antifreeze/water mix.
   If the Message centre displays the message
   ENGINE OVERHEATING, pull off the carriageway
   and allow the engine to idle for 5 minutes and
   then switch off the ignition for 10 minutes.
   Switch on the engine and, provided that the
   warning does not occur, continue your journey,
   avoiding harsh acceleration. Seek qualified
   assistance as soon as possible.
   TOPPING UP THE COOLANT
   Never remove the filler cap when the
   engine is hot.
   Antifreeze is highly inflammable. Do
   not allow antifreeze to come into
   contact with naked flames or other
   sources of ignition (e.g., a hot engine)

- a fire may result.
  Unscrew the filler cap slowly, allowing
  the pressure to escape before removing
  completely.
  When travelling in territories where the
  water supply contains salt, always make
  sure you carry a supply of fresh (rain or
  distilled) water. Topping up with salt
  water will cause serious engine damage.

  Fluid level checks

Top up to the upper level indicator mark, located
on the side of the expansion tank. For the
coolant fluid specification, see 201,
LUBRICANTS AND FLUIDS.
Note: In an emergency, and only if the approved
antifreeze is unavailable, top up the cooling
system with clean water, but be aware of the
resultant reduction in frost protection. Do not
top up or refill with conventional antifreeze
formulations. If in doubt, consult a qualified
technician.
Make sure the cap is tightened fully after top up
is completed, by turning the cap until the ratchet
cap clicks.
CHECKING THE BRAKE FLUID LEVEL
Seek qualified assistance immediately
if brake pedal travel is unusually long,
unusually short, or if there is any
significant loss of brake fluid. Driving
under such conditions could result in
extended stopping distances or
complete brake failure.
If the quantity of fluid in the brake
reservoir drops below the
recommended level, a red warning
lamp in the Instrument panel will
illuminate and the message Brake
Fluid Low will be displayed in the
Message centre.
Note: If the warning lamp illuminates or the
message is displayed while the vehicle is being
driven, stop the vehicle as soon as safety
permits by gently applying the brakes. Check
and top up the fluid level, if necessary.
Brake fluid is highly toxic - keep
containers sealed and out of the reach
of children. If accidental consumption
is suspected, seek medical attention
immediately.
If the fluid comes into contact with the
skin or eyes, rinse immediately with
plenty of clean water.
Brake fluid is highly inflammable. Do
not allow brake fluid to come into
contact with naked flames or other
sources of ignition (e.g., a hot engine).
Do not drive the vehicle with the fluid
level below the MIN mark.
With the vehicle on level ground, check the fluid
level at least every week (more frequently in
high mileage or arduous operating conditions).
The brake fluid level should be between the MIN
and the MAX marks on the side of the reservoir.
The fluid level may drop slightly during normal
use, as a result of brake pad wear, but should
not be allowed to drop below the MIN mark.
TOPPING UP THE BRAKE FLUID
Brake fluid will damage painted surfaces.
Soak up any spillage with an absorbent
cloth immediately, and wash the area
with a mixture of car shampoo and
water.
Only use new fluid from an airtight
container (fluid from open containers or
fluid previously bled from the system,
will have absorbed moisture, which will
adversely affect performance and must
not be used).
