USING THE SEAT BELTS

1. Draw the belt out smoothly, make sure that
   the seat, and your position on the seat are
   correct.
   WARNING: Seat belts (or child seat
   latch restraints, tether straps and
   harnesses) should be used by all
   vehicle occupants, for every trip, no
   matter how short. Failure to do so will
   greatly increase the risk of death or
   serious injury in the event of an
   accident.
   Seatbelts are designed to bear upon
   the bony structure of the body, and
   should be worn low across the front of
   the pelvis or the pelvis, chest and
   shoulders, as applicable; wearing the
   lap section of the belt across the
   abdominal area must be avoided.
   Seatbelts should be adjusted as firmly
   as possible, consistent with comfort,
   to provide the protection for which they
   have been designed. A slack belt will
   greatly reduce the protection afforded
   to the wearer.
   No modifications or additions should
   be made by the user which will either
   prevent the seat belt adjusting devices
   from operating to remove slack, or
   prevent the seat belt assembly from
   being adjusted to remove slack.
   Belts should not be worn with straps
   twisted.
   Each belt assembly must only be used
   by one occupant; it is dangerous to put
   a belt around a child being carried on
   the occupant's lap.
   Occupants should not travel with the
   seat back reclined excessively. Doing
   so will reduce the protection afforded
   by the seat belt.
   Never place anything between you and
   the seat belt. It can be dangerous and
   reduce the effectiveness of the seat
   belt in preventing injury.
2. With the seat belt correctly positioned, place
   the metal tongue into the buckle nearest to
   you. Press it in until a click is heard. Make
   sure that all slack has been taken up by the
   retractor and the belt fits tightly across the
   hips.
   Note: When releasing the seat belt, it is
   advisable to hold the belt before pressing
   the release button. This will prevent the belt
   from retracting too quickly.
   To release the seat belt, press the red
   button.

3. Use of seat belts during pregnancy:
   Position the lap strap comfortably across
   the hips, beneath the abdomen. Place the
   diagonal part of the seat belt between the
   breasts and to the side of the abdomen.
   Position the seat belt correctly for the
   safety of the mother and unborn child.
   Never wear just the lap strap, and
   never sit on the lap strap whilst using
   just the shoulder strap. Both of these
   actions are extremely dangerous and
   increase your risk of serious injury in
   the event of an accident or during
   emergency braking.
   Never place anything between you and
   the seat belt in an attempt to cushion
   the impact in the event of an accident.
   It can be dangerous and reduce the
   effectiveness of the seat belt in
   preventing injury.
   Make sure that the seat belt is not
   slack or twisted.
   SEAT BELT SAFETY
   Care should be taken to avoid
   contamination of the webbing with
   polishes, oils and chemicals, and
   particularly battery acid. Cleaning may
   safely be carried out using mild soap
   and water. The belt should be replaced
   if webbing becomes frayed,
   contaminated or damaged. See 152,
   SEAT BELTS.
   It is essential to replace the entire
   assembly after it has been worn in a
   severe impact even if damage to the
   assembly is not obvious.
   Do not carry hard, fragile or sharp
   items between your person and the
   seat belt.
   Never wear just the lap belt or just the
   shoulder belt of a lap/shoulder
   diagonal seat belt. Both of these
   actions are extremely dangerous and
   may increase your risk of injury.
   Seat belts should be worn by all
   vehicle occupants, for every journey,
   no matter how short.
   When using seat belts to restrain items
   other than occupants, take care to
   make sure that the belts are not
   damaged, or exposed to sharp edges.
   No modifications or additions should
   be made by the user which will either
   prevent the seat belt adjusting devices
   from operating to remove slack, or
   prevent the seat belt assembly from
   being adjusted to remove slack.
   SEAT BELT CHECKS
   The seat belts should be inspected regularly to
   check for fraying, cuts or wear to the webbing,
   and the condition and security of the
   mechanism, buckles, adjusters, and mounting
   points.
   •
   With the seat belt fastened, give the
   webbing near the buckle a quick upward
   pull. The buckle must remain securely
   locked.
   •
   With the seat belt unfastened, unreel the
   seat belt to the limit of its travel. Check that
   it unreels smoothly with no snatches or
   snags. Allow the belt to fully retract, again
   checking for smooth operation.
   •
   Partially unreel the seat belt, then hold the
   tongue plate and give a quick forward pull.
   The mechanism must lock and prevent any
   further unreeling.

   Seat belts

Note: If the vehicle is parked on an incline, the
seat belt mechanism may lock. This is a safety
feature and the belt should be gently eased out
from the upper anchorage.
If any of the seat belts fail to meet those criteria,
immediately contact your Dealer/Authorised
Repairer.
SEAT BELT PRE-TENSIONERS
The seat belt pre-tensioners activate in
conjunction with the Supplementary Restraint
System (SRS) to provide additional protection
in the event of a severe frontal impact. They
automatically reduce any slack in a seat belt to
reduce forward movement of a front seat
occupant.
The seat belt pre-tensioners will
activate only once and then must be
replaced. Failure to replace them will
reduce the effectiveness of the SRS in
reducing the risk of serious injury or
death in the event of an accident.
After any impact, have the seat belts
and pre-tensioners checked and, if
necessary, replaced by a
Dealer/Authorised Repairer.
SEAT BELT REMINDER
Seat belt reminder commences when the vehicle
is in motion and the driver's belt is unbuckled.
Dependent on market, the warning indicator in
the Instrument panel illuminates (see 39, SEAT
BELT (RED)), and an audible chime sounds. The
visual and audible warnings applicable to the
Seat belt reminder feature are market dependent
to meet individual market requirements. The
warning signals given may also change
depending on whether the vehicle is stationary
or when the vehicle's speed exceeds a
predetermined threshold. In certain markets,
the Seat belt reminder feature also applies to
the passenger seat.
A graphic in the Message centre also indicates
which seat belts are fastened at the start of a
journey and also when a seat belt is fastened
or unfastened during a journey.
Each seating position is represented by a
passenger icon, the colour and symbol of which
indicates the seat belt status:
•
Tick - seat belt in the indicated position is
fastened.
•
Cross - seat belt in the indicated position
has been unfastened while the vehicle's
ignition is on. This indicator will turn grey
after 30 seconds.
•
Grey - seat belt not fastened.
