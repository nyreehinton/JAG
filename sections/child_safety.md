# Child safety

NEVER use a rearward facing child
restraint on a seat protected by an
ACTIVE AIRBAG in front of it, DEATH or
SERIOUS INJURY to the CHILD can
occur.
CHILD RESTRAINT CHECK LIST
Every time a child travels in the vehicle, observe
the following:
•
Disable the front passenger airbag. See 33,
DISABLING THE PASSENGER AIRBAG.
•
Use appropriate child restraints.
•
Carefully follow the restraint system
manufacturer's instructions.
•
Adjust the harnesses for every child on
every journey.
•
Make sure that all slack is removed from
the adult seat belt.
•
Always check the security of the child
restraint.
•
Do not dress a child in bulky clothing, or
place any objects/padding between the child
and the restraint.
•
Regularly check the fit and condition of child
restraints. If the fit is poor, or wear/damage
is visible, replace the restraint immediately.
•
Set a good example - always wear your seat
belt.

- Always make sure that the passenger airbag
  has been disabled before using a child restraint
  in this seating position. The seatback needs to
  be adjusted to the fully upright position.
  Note: Ages given are approximate. In case of
  doubt, the child’s weight, not age, should be
  used when considering an appropriate child
  seat.

  BOOSTER SEATS
  In a situation where a child is too large to fit
  into a child safety seat, but is still too small to
  safely fit the three-point belt properly, a booster
  seat is recommended for maximum safety.
  Follow the manufacturer's instructions for fitting
  and use, then adjust the seat belt to suit.

AIRBAGS

1. Airbag warning information is printed on
   the passenger sun visor.
2. Driver’s airbag.
3. Front passenger airbag.
4. Curtain airbags (Coupe only).
5. Seat-mounted thorax airbags (Coupe).
   Seat-mounted head/thorax airbags
   (Convertible).
   Note: The general location of airbags fitted to
   the vehicle are marked by the word AIRBAG.
   Always contact a Dealer/Authorised Repairer if:
   •
   An airbag inflates.
   •
   The front or sides of the vehicle are
   damaged.
   •
   Any part of the airbag Supplementary
   Restraint System (SRS) shows signs of
   cracking or damage, including trim covering
   the airbags.
   •
   The amber airbag warning lamp illuminates.
   AIRBAG OPERATION
   Do not allow passengers to obstruct
   the operation of the airbags by placing
   any part of their person or any objects
   in contact with, or close to, an airbag
   module. Only use approved
   accessories (e.g., seat covers).
   Make sure that a gap is maintained
   between the side of the vehicle, and
   the head and torso. This will enable
   unobstructed inflation of the seat
   mounted side airbags.

   Airbags

Airbags inflate at high speeds. To
minimise the risk of injury, make sure
that all vehicle occupants wear
correctly positioned seat belts, sit
correctly in the seats, and position the
seats as far back as is practical.
Airbag inflation takes place
instantaneously, and cannot protect
against the effects of secondary
impacts. Under these circumstances,
the only protection will be provided by
a correctly worn seat belt.
Phone systems should only be installed
by qualified persons familiar with the
operation of, and requirements for,
vehicles fitted with SRS. If you are in
any doubt, seek advice from your
Dealer/Authorised Repairer.
Airbag deployment is dependent on the rate at
which the passenger compartment changes
velocity following the collision. Circumstances
affecting different collisions (vehicle speed,
angle of impact, type and size of object hit, etc.),
vary considerably and will affect the rate of
deceleration accordingly.
Airbags cannot deploy correctly if they are
obstructed. Examples of obstructions are:
•
Any part of an occupants body in contact
with, or close to, an airbag cover.
•
Objects placed on, or close to, an airbag
cover.
•
Clothing, cushions, or other material,
covering seat-mounted airbags.
•
Seat covers which are not approved by
Jaguar or specifically designed for use with
seat-mounted airbags.
This list is not exhaustive and it remains the
responsibility of the driver and passenger to
make sure that the airbags are not obstructed
in any way.
The SRS is not designed to operate as a result
of:
•
Rear impacts.
•
Minor front impacts.
•
Minor side impacts.
•
Heavy braking.
•
Driving over bumps and pot holes.
Therefore, it follows that considerable superficial
damage to the vehicle can occur, without
causing the airbags to deploy.
FRONT AIRBAGS
The front passenger and driver airbags are able
to deploy in 2 stages, depending on the severity
of the frontal impact. In a severe impact, the
airbags inflate fully to offer maximum
protection. In a lesser impact, full deployment
is not required, so the airbags are partially
inflated.
SIDE AND CURTAIN AIRBAGS
Side Airbags
The side airbags are designed to protect the
thorax region of the torso and will deploy only
in the event of a side impact and then, only on
the side of the impact.
On Convertible vehicles this airbag, in addition,
protects the head of the occupant.
Curtain Airbags (Coupe only)
The curtain airbags are deployed in side impacts
and rollover events, providing greater protection
from serious head injuries.
