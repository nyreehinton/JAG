# Suspension

IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Do not rest your foot on the brake pedal
while the vehicle is in motion.
Never allow the vehicle to coast
(freewheel) with the engine turned off.
The engine must be running to provide
full braking assistance. The brakes will
still function with the engine off, but
far more pressure will be required to
operate them.
If the red brake warning lamp
illuminates, safely bring the vehicle to
a stop, as quickly as possible and seek
qualified assistance. See 38, BRAKE
(RED).
If the yellow brake warning lamp
illuminates, drive with care, avoiding
heavy brake application and seek
qualified assistance. See 39, BRAKE
(YELLOW).
Never place non-approved floor
matting or any other obstructions under
the pedals. This restricts pedal travel
and braking efficiency.
Additional brake pedal force may be
required in wet conditions.
On vehicles with carbon ceramic
brakes, it is recommended that the
brake fluid is replaced prior to using
the vehicle on closed roads. It is also
recommended that the brake fluid is
replaced after driving the vehicle on
closed roads.
Only use the recommended brake fluid.
See 201, LUBRICANTS AND FLUIDS.
Note: Operating noise levels of carbon ceramic
brake discs can be higher than those associated
with iron brake discs.
Note: Brake disc and pad wear will increase if
aggressive braking techniques are employed.
Note: On vehicles with carbon ceramic brakes,
the brake fluid requires replacing every 2 years
regardless of distance, and not every 3 years
as stated in your Service Portfolio.
Driving through heavy rain or water can have
an adverse effect on braking efficiency. Under
such circumstances, it is recommended that
you lightly apply the brakes intermittently, to
dry the brakes.
EMERGENCY BRAKE ASSIST (EBA)
If the driver rapidly applies the brakes, EBA
automatically boosts the braking force to its
maximum, in order to bring the vehicle to a halt
as quickly as possible.
EBA stops operating as soon as the brake pedal
is released.
A fault with the EBA system is indicated by the
brake warning lamp (see 38, BRAKE (RED))
illuminating and a warning message displayed
in the Message centre. Drive with care, avoiding
heavy brake application and seek qualified
assistance.
ELECTRONIC BRAKE FORCE
DISTRIBUTION (EBD)
EBD controls the balance of braking forces
supplied to the front and rear wheels, in order
to maintain maximum braking efficiency.
If the vehicle has a light load (only the driver in
the vehicle, for example), EBD will reduce the
braking force applied to the rear wheels. If the
vehicle is heavily laden, EBD will allow greater
braking force to the rear wheels.
A fault with the EBD system is indicated by the
brake warning lamp (see 38, BRAKE (RED))
illuminating and an associated warning
message. Gently and safely stop the vehicle and
seek qualified assistance.
