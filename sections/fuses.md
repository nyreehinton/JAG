## Overview

This section provides information about the fuse locations and specifications for the Jaguar F-Type. Fuses protect electrical circuits from damage caused by excessive current flow.

**Important Safety Information:**

- **Always disconnect the battery** before replacing fuses
- **Use only the correct fuse rating** - never use a higher rated fuse
- **Check the circuit** if a fuse blows repeatedly
- **Consult a qualified technician** if you're unsure about fuse replacement
