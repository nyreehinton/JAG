provides a means of escape in the event of
someone being locked in the Luggage

themselves with the operation of the release
handle.
The release handle glows in the dark and is
located inside the Luggage compartment, as
illustrated. To open the Luggage compartment
from the inside, pull the handle while pushing
the Luggage compartment lid/tailgate upwards.
Return the handle to its stowage position after
use.
