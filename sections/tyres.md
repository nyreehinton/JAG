# Tyres

Note: A dedicated winter tyre often has a lower
speed rating than the original equipment tyre,
and the vehicle must therefore be driven within
the speed limitation of the tyre. Consult your
Dealer/Authorised Repairer for further
information. In markets that require a tyre's
maximum speed label to be fitted, the tyre's
maximum speed label should be placed within
the driver's field of vision. These can be
obtained from the tyre dealer.
This symbol identifies dedicated
winter tyres, which can be fitted if
optimum winter traction is required,
or the vehicle is to be used in more
extreme winter conditions.
Winter tyres must be fitted to all 4 wheels.
For optimum traction, tyres should be run in for
at least 160 kilometres (100 miles) on dry
roads, prior to driving on snow or ice.
Use of dedicated winter tyres may require a
change of wheel size, depending on the original
choice of wheel. All 4 wheels must be changed.
If fitted with standard rubber valves, the Tyre
Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) warning
lamp will flash for 75 seconds and then remain
illuminated. The Message centre will also
display TYRE PRESSURE MONITORING
SYSTEM FAULT.
When the original wheels and tyres are refitted,
the vehicle will need to travel a short distance
to reset the TPMS and extinguish the warning
lamp.

USING SNOW CHAINS
It is essential that only snow chains of
the recommended type are fitted.
Snow chains can only be fitted to the rear
wheels. They should not be used on
temporary-use spare wheels.
Contact a Dealer/Authorised Repairer for details
and availability of approved snow chains.
The maximum speed when using snow chains
is 50 km/h (30 mph).

Tyres

Note: When using snow chains, select
Rain/Ice/Snow mode, see 82, JAGUARDRIVE
CONTROL, and switch DSC off. See 81,
SWITCHING DSC OFF. DSC reduces deep snow
traction capability, as it limits wheel spin to a
level below that which is required to generate
maximum traction.
TYRE DECLARATION (India only)
All imported tyres meet the requirements of
Bureau of India Standards (BIS) and comply
with the requirements under Central Motor
Vehicle Rules (CMVR) 1989. The tyres are the
same as those tyres supplied as Original
Equipment (OE) for Jaguar models which are
fully Type Approved for the Indian market.

TYRE PRESSURE MONITORING
SYSTEM
TPMS provides a low pressure warning
and does not re-inflate your tyres. Tyre
pressures should be checked regularly,
using an accurate pressure gauge when
the tyres are cold.
TPMS can NOT register damage to a
tyre. Regularly check the condition of
your tyres, especially if the vehicle is
driven off-road.
When inflating tyres, care should be
taken to avoid bending or damaging the
TPMS valves. Always confirm correct
alignment of the inflation head to the
valve stem.
Note: Different types of tyre may affect TPMS
performance. Always replace tyres in
accordance with recommendations.
TPMS constantly monitors the tyre pressure in
each wheel except, for the temporary-use spare
tyre (when fitted) which is not monitored.
Wheels fitted with TPMS can be visually
identified by the external metal lock nut and
valve (1). All Jaguar non-TPMS wheels have a
rubber valve fitted (2).
Tyre pressures should be checked regularly
when the tyres are cold, and adjusted as
necessary. The presence of TPMS does not
remove the need to do this.
The tyre pressure warning lamp, see 40, TYRE
PRESSURE MONITORING SYSTEM (YELLOW),
illuminates when one or more of the tyres are
significantly under-inflated. In addition to this,
a warning message and the current pressure,
is displayed in the Message centre below a
graphic which shows which tyre is
under-inflated. Stop and check the tyres as soon
as possible and inflate them to the
recommended pressure.
Vehicles supplied with 20 inch wheels also have
a speed based TPMS system. If the vehicle is
required to travel at speeds of over 250 km/h
(155 mph), the tyre pressures should be raised.
See 177, TYRE PRESSURES. Failure to do this
may cause the warning message TYRE
PRESSURES LOW FOR SPEED to be displayed
in the Message centre.
Note: Make sure to set the tyre pressures to the
correct pressure when the vehicle will be
travelling at speeds of less than 250 km/h (155
mph).
TEMPORARY USE SPARE WHEEL AND
TYRE CHANGE
If the temporary-use spare wheel is fitted, the
system will automatically recognise the change
in wheel positions. After approximately
minutes of driving above 25 km/h (18 mph),
the message FRONT[REAR] RIGHT[LEFT] TYRE
PRESSURE NOT MONITORED will be displayed,
accompanied by illumination of the warning
lamp.
184
Tyre pressure monitoring system (TPMS)

The warning lamp will first flash and then
illuminate continuously. Extended use of the
temporary-use spare wheel will trigger the
message TYRE PRESSURE MONITORING
SYSTEM FAULT.
This TPMS display sequence will be activated
at every ignition cycle until the temporary spare
wheel is replaced by a full size road wheel with
a TPMS sensor fitted.
Note: If in use, always replace the temporary
spare wheel before having a TPMS fault
investigated.

TYRE REPAIR KIT
If you are in any doubt regarding your
ability to carry out the instructions,
contact a Dealer/Authorised Repairer
before attempting the repair.
Your vehicle may not be equipped with a spare
tyre. Alternatively your vehicle will be fitted with
a tyre repair kit which can be used to repair one
tyre. It is essential that you read the following
guide before attempting to repair a tyre.
The tyre repair kit consists of a canister of
sealant located below the Luggage compartment
left-side (battery) cover, in front of the vehicle's
battery as shown, and a compressor located in
the Luggage compartment.
Note: Vehicles with carbon ceramic brake discs
are supplied with two wheel guide pins. The
pins are stored with the compressor.
The tyre repair kit seals most punctures with a
maximum diameter of 6 mm (1/4 inch).
The tyre repair kit is located under the floor
panel in the Luggage compartment. If required,
also remove the Luggage compartment left-side
(battery) cover.
Note: The sealant used in the tyre repair kit has
a shelf life and the expiry date is shown on the
tyre sealant bottle. Make sure the container is
replaced before the expiry date.
TYRE REPAIR KIT SAFETY
INFORMATION
Some tyre damage may only be
partially sealed, or may not seal at all,
depending on the amount and type of
damage. Any loss of tyre pressure can
seriously affect vehicle safety.
Do not use the tyre repair kit if the tyre
has been damaged by driving while
under-inflated.
A - Tyre tread area.
Only use the tyre repair kit to seal
damage located within the tyre tread
area (A).
Do not exceed 80 km/h (50 mph) when
a repaired tyre is fitted to the vehicle.
The maximum distance that should be
driven when a repaired tyre is fitted,
is 200 km (125 miles).
When a repaired tyre is fitted, drive
with caution and avoid sudden braking
or steering manoeuvres.
