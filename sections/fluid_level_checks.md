## Overview

This section covers the essential fluid level checks for your Jaguar F-Type, including brake fluid, power steering fluid, washer fluid, and battery care. Regular fluid level maintenance is crucial for vehicle safety and performance.

**Important**: Always perform fluid level checks with the engine switched off and the vehicle on level ground.

## Brake Fluid Level

### Checking and Topping Up Brake Fluid

**Safety First**: Brake fluid is critical for vehicle safety. If you're unsure about the procedure, seek qualified assistance.

#### Step-by-Step Procedure

1. **Clean the filler cap** with a clean, dry cloth before removing to prevent dirt or moisture from entering the reservoir
2. **Remove the filler cap**
3. **Top up the reservoir** with the specified brake fluid to at least the MIN mark
   - **Reference**: See section 201, LUBRICANTS AND FLUIDS
   - **Important**: Do not top up to the MAX mark unless brake pads have been replaced
4. **Replace the cap**
5. **Refit the under bonnet cover**
   - **Reference**: See section 146, UNDER BONNET COVERS - REFITTING

## Power Steering Fluid Level

### Safety Warnings

**Critical Safety Information**:

- **Power steering fluid is highly toxic** - Keep containers sealed and out of reach of children
- **Seek medical attention immediately** if accidental consumption is suspected
- **Rinse immediately** with plenty of clean water if fluid contacts skin or eyes
- **Power steering fluid is highly inflammable** - Keep away from naked flames or hot engines
- **Do not start the engine** if fluid level has dropped below the MIN mark
- **Seek qualified assistance immediately** if there is a noticeable drop in fluid level

### Checking Power Steering Fluid

#### Prerequisites

- Vehicle on level ground
- Engine switched off
- System cold
- Steering wheel not turned after stopping the engine

#### Procedure

1. **Locate the reservoir** - The fluid level can be seen through the translucent body of the reservoir
   - **Reference**: See section 153, FLUID FILLER LOCATIONS
2. **Check the fluid level** - Should be between the MIN and MAX marks

### Topping Up Power Steering Fluid

#### Important Precautions

- **Use only new fluid** - Never return drained fluid to the system
- **Clean the area** around the filler neck before and after topping up
- **Avoid contamination** - The system must not become contaminated in any way
- **Handle spills carefully** - Power steering fluid damages painted surfaces
  - Soak up spillage with absorbent cloth immediately
  - Wash area with car shampoo and water mixture

#### Step-by-Step Procedure

1. **Clean the filler cap** before removing to prevent dirt from entering the reservoir
2. **Remove the filler cap**
3. **Top up the reservoir** until fluid level is between MIN and MAX marks
   - **Reference**: See section 201, LUBRICANTS AND FLUIDS for power steering fluid specification
4. **Replace the filler cap**

## Washer Fluid Level

### Safety Precautions

- **Do not allow** screen washer fluid to come into contact with naked flames or sources of ignition
- **Use frost protection** if operating in temperatures below 4°C (40°F)
- **Use only approved** washer fluid
- **Avoid spillage** - Wash affected areas immediately with clean water if spillage occurs

### System Overview

The washer reservoir supplies both the windscreen and headlamp washer jets.

**Monitoring**: The Message centre will display a message when the washer bottle requires more fluid.

- **Reference**: See section 35, INSTRUMENT PANEL MENU

**Maintenance**: Operate the washers periodically to check that nozzles are clear and properly directed.

### Topping Up Washer Fluid

#### Step-by-Step Procedure

1. **Clean the filler cap** before opening to prevent dirt from entering the reservoir
2. **Open the filler cap**
3. **Top up the reservoir** with specified washer fluid until fluid is visible in the filler neck
   - **Reference**: See section 201, LUBRICANTS AND FLUIDS
4. **Close the filler cap**
