ELECTRIC PARKING BRAKE (EPB)
The Parking brakes operate on the rear
wheels; therefore, secure parking of the
vehicle is dependent on being on a hard
and stable surface.
Do not rely on the Parking brake to
operate effectively, if the rear wheels
have been immersed in mud or water.
With the ignition switched on, press the brake
pedal and press down on the EPB switch (1).
This will release the Parking brake.
With the vehicle stationary, press the brake
pedal and pull up the EPB switch (2). This will
apply the Parking brake. A warning lamp (see
39, PARKING BRAKE (RED)) illuminates to
indicate that the Parking brake is applied.
If the EPB switch is operated when the vehicle's
speed is less than 3 km/h (2 mph), the vehicle
will be brought to an abrupt stop. The stop
lamps will not be illuminated.
Driving the vehicle with the Parking
brake applied, or repeated use of the
Parking brake to slow the vehicle, may
cause serious damage to the brake
system.
In an emergency, with the vehicle travelling at
more than 3 km/h (2 mph), pulling on the EPB
switch and holding gives a gradual reduction in
the speed. The brake warning lamp will
illuminate accompanied by a warning tone and
a warning message in the Message centre. The
stop lamps will illuminate.
If the vehicle is stationary with the EPB applied
and the transmission in P, selecting D, N, or R
will release the EPB and allow the vehicle to
move off. See 78, AUTOMATIC
TRANSMISSION.
Note: Automatic release of the EPB is only
possible when the driver’s door is closed or the
driver’s seat belt is buckled.
If the system detects a fault with the EPB, the
amber brake warning lamp will illuminate
accompanied by a message in the Message
centre.
If the system detects a fault while the EPB is
operating, the red Parking brake warning lamp
will flash, accompanied by a message in the
Message centre.
Note: The red Parking brake warning lamp will
continue to be illuminated for at least
seconds after the ignition has been turned off.

USING THE PARKING AID
Parking aids may not detect moving
objects, such as children and animals,
until they are dangerously close.
Always use extreme caution when
manoeuvring.
Parking aid sensors may not detect
some obstructions (e.g., narrow posts
or small objects close to the ground).
If accessories are fitted to the rear of the
vehicle, particular care must be taken
when reversing. The rear sensors will
only indicate the distance from the
bumper to the obstacle.

1. Parking aid switch: Press to turn on or off.
2. Parking aid detection range.
   When Reverse (R) is selected, the front and rear
   parking sensors are activated automatically, and
   the indicator on the Parking aid switch will
   illuminate.
   When Drive (D) is selected, the front sensors
   must be activated by pressing the Parking aid
   switch; the switch indicator will illuminate.
   To turn off the system when active, press the
   switch; the switch indicator will extinguish.
   The range of the Parking aid sensors varies
   between the front, rear, and corners of the
   vehicle.
   When activated, the front sensors will remain
   active as long as the vehicle's forward speed
   does not exceed 16 km/h (10 mph).
   Selecting N from R will keep front and rear
   sensors active.
   When Parking aid is active, a pop-up appears
   on the Touch screen showing a plan view of the
   vehicle and the immediate surrounding area.
   Touch Display Off to cancel the view.

   Parking aids

Note: If a rear camera is fitted, when Reverse
(R) gear is selected, the camera display is
selected automatically. To view the Parking aid
display, touch the screen.
When objects are detected, the Parking aid
emits a warning tone which increases in
frequency as the vehicle gets closer to the object
and then becomes constant when the obstacle
is within 300 mm (12 ins).
Note: The front Parking aid provides an audible
proximity warning when driving forwards and
when reversing.
CLEANING THE SENSORS
When washing the vehicle, do not aim
high pressure water jets directly at the
sensors. Do not use abrasive materials
or hard/sharp objects to clean the
sensors. Only use approved vehicle
shampoo.
The sensors should be kept clean to maintain
accuracy and performance.
PARKING AID SYSTEM FAULT
If a system fault is detected, a long high-pitched
tone will sound, and the switch indicator will
flash. Contact your Dealer/Authorised Repairer
as soon as possible.
PARKING AID VOLUME
To set the volume of the Parking aid warning
tones:
•
Select Setup from the Touch screen Home
menu, then select System.
•
Select Volume presets, then use the + or -
soft keys alongside Parking aid to adjust
the volume for both the front and rear
warning tones, or rotate the volume control
when the warning tones are sounding.
REAR CAMERA
It remains the driver's responsibility
to detect obstacles and estimate the
vehicle's distance from them when
reversing.
When Reverse gear (R) is selected, the Touch
screen automatically displays a wide-angle,
colour image from the rear of your vehicle.
The rear camera system provides a rear-view
image to assist in reversing the vehicle. Overlaid
on the image are reversing guidelines.
A. Solid line: The projected wheel trajectory.
B. Dotted line: The safe working width of the
vehicle (including exterior mirrors).
C. Luggage compartment access guidelines:
Do not reverse past this point if Luggage
compartment access is required.
D. Parking aid sensor activation: a coloured
area appears to indicate which rear
sensor(s) is active.
