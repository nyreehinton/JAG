## Overview

Airbags are a critical component of the vehicle's Supplementary Restraint System (SRS), designed to provide additional protection in the event of a collision.

### Airbag Deployment Effects

When an airbag inflates, a fine powder is released. This is **normal** and not an indication of a malfunction. The powder may cause irritation to the skin and should be thoroughly flushed from eyes and any cuts or abrasions.

Airbag deployment is accompanied by a very loud noise which may cause discomfort and temporary loss of hearing.

## Airbag Warning Lamp

The airbag warning lamp is mounted in the Instrument panel and will illuminate as a bulb check when the ignition is switched on.

### Warning Lamp Conditions

**If the warning lamp signals that a fault is present in the system, do not use a child restraint on the front passenger seat.**

The vehicle should be checked by your Dealer/Authorised Repairer immediately if any of the following conditions occur:

- The warning lamp fails to illuminate when the START/STOP button is initially switched on
- The warning lamp fails to extinguish within (approximately) 6 seconds of the START/STOP button being switched on
- The warning lamp illuminates at any time, other than during the bulb check

---

## System Monitoring

When the ignition is switched on, a diagnostic control unit monitors the readiness of the system's electrical circuits. The elements of the Supplementary Restraint System (SRS) being monitored include:

- SRS warning indicator
- Rotary coupler
- Airbag modules
- Seat belt pre-tensioners
- Airbag diagnostic control unit
- Crash sensors
- Airbag wiring harnesses
- Airbag status indicator
- Front seat belt buckle switches
- Front seat track position sensors
- Rollover sensors (Coupe only)

## Passenger Airbag Control

### Disabling the Passenger Airbag

**Note:** This feature is not available in Australia.

The passenger airbag should be disabled **only** when a child restraint is fitted to the front passenger seat.

**WARNING:** Do not use a child restraint on a seat protected by an operational airbag in front of it. Doing so presents a high risk of death or serious injury to the child in the event of an accident.

### How to Control the Passenger Airbag

The passenger airbag can be switched on and off using the interactive controls on the Instrument panel when the vehicle is stationary. See [Instrument Panel Menu](#instrument-panel-menu) for detailed instructions.

#### Step-by-Step Procedure

1. **Access the Vehicle Set-up menu** located in the Main menu
2. **Select "Passenger Airbag"** from the options
3. **View current status** - the displayed text and diagram will show the current Passenger Airbag On or Off status
4. **Select "Change Setting"** to choose either On or Off

### Warning Indicators

- A warning lamp in the roof console will illuminate if "Passenger Airbag Off" setting is selected
- The Instrument panel will also display a warning for 4 seconds every time the ignition is switched on

### Important Safety Reminders

**CRITICAL:** As soon as the child seat is removed from the front passenger seat, the airbag **must** be turned on. Failure to do so will put any front seat passengers at greater risk of death or serious injury in the event of an accident.

When checking the operational status of the front passenger airbag, make sure that the ignition is switched on.

**Do not fit a child restraint** to the front passenger seat if the airbag warning lamp illuminates continuously with the ignition on.

## Safety Information

### Critical Safety Warnings

**NEVER attempt to service, repair, replace, modify, or tamper with any part of the SRS.** This includes wiring or components in the vicinity of SRS components. Doing so may cause the system to trigger, or render the system inoperative.

**NEVER use any electrical test equipment or devices** in the vicinity of SRS components or wiring. Doing so may cause the system to trigger, or render the system inoperative.

### Prohibited Operations

The following operations should **only** be carried out by a Dealer/Authorised Repairer, or suitably qualified person:

- Removal or repair of any wiring or component in the vicinity of any SRS components
- Installation of electrical, or electronic, equipment and accessories
- Modification to the front or sides of the vehicle's exterior
- Attachment of accessories to the front or sides of the vehicle

---

## Service and Maintenance

### Professional Service Requirements

All SRS-related operations require professional expertise. Never attempt to:

- Disconnect or modify airbag wiring
- Install aftermarket electrical equipment near SRS components
- Modify vehicle exterior that could affect airbag sensors
- Attach accessories that could interfere with airbag deployment

### Regular System Checks

- Have the airbag system inspected during regular service intervals
- Address any warning lamp issues immediately
- Ensure all SRS components are functioning properly
- Follow manufacturer recommendations for system maintenance

## Disability Modifications

### Important Notice

Occupants with disabilities which may require modification of the vehicle **must contact a Dealer/Authorised Repairer** before any modifications are made.

### Modification Considerations

- Any vehicle modifications must be approved by qualified professionals
- SRS components must not be compromised by modifications
- Special seating arrangements may require airbag system adjustments
- Professional assessment ensures safety compliance

## Warning and Information Messages

### Message Priority System

**Do not ignore warning messages** - take appropriate action as soon as possible. Failure to do so may result in serious damage to the vehicle.

If a message is suppressed, an amber or red warning icon will remain illuminated until the cause of the message is rectified.

### Message Display Features

- Messages are displayed in order of importance, with critical warning messages being the highest priority
- If more than one message is active, each is displayed in turn for 2 seconds
- Warning messages may be accompanied by an audible warning
- Message text may have the handbook symbol next to it for additional reference

### Message Management

Warning messages are displayed until the condition causing the fault is rectified or the message is suppressed using the OK button on the steering wheel. If the message is suppressed, a warning icon will remain illuminated until the cause of the message is rectified.

For detailed information regarding individual messages, their meanings, and required actions, please refer to the relevant section within this handbook.
