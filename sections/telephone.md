   PHONEBOOK
   Contacts stored in the memory of a paired
   phone can be automatically downloaded to the
   vehicle’s phonebook each time the phone is
   connected to the system. See 118, TELEPHONE
   COMPATIBILITY.
   Certain mobile phones store the phonebook in
   two different areas, the SIM card and the
   phone's memory. The vehicle's system will
   access only those numbers stored in the
   phone's memory.
   To access contacts from the phonebook:
10. From the Phone menu, select Phonebook.
11. Using the alpha keys, select the letter you
    wish to search under. Repeated selections
    of the same key, scrolls through the letters
    displayed on the keys.

13. Identify the required contact from the
    displayed list and touch to call. If a contact
    has more than one number stored, select
    the required number from the list.
    Note: It may be necessary to use the scroll
    bar to see the entire list.
    There are also options to view more contact
    information, by selecting the corresponding
    i key.
    If your phone supports contact type data, you
    will be able to see a contact type icon in the
    vehicle's phonebook directory. These can be
    seen on the right side of each contact in the
    directory and will indicate one of the following
    types:
    Default.
    Mobile.

THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
Navigation instruction is by map and turn
information displayed on the Touch screen and
can be complemented by voice guidance, if
required. The system uses signals from Global
Positioning System (GPS) satellites, combined
with information from vehicle sensors and from
data stored on the hard drive, to establish the
true vehicle's position.
Note: Mapping data loaded on the hard drive is
relevant to the market in which the vehicle is
first sold and will provide guidance and
information only for that area. Your Jaguar
Dealer/Authorised Repairer will have details of
software updates. Map updates can also be
acquired from the Ownership section of the
jaguar website at <www.jaguar.com>.
Using this combination of data sources, the
vehicle's navigation computer enables you to
plan and follow a route map to your desired
destination.
The Touch screen is used to control navigation
via menus, text screens, and map displays.
Operate the system only when it is safe
to do so.
Note: The Navigation system fitted to your
vehicle does not support speed camera alerts.
The requirements of national Road Traffic
Regulations always apply.
Observation of traffic signs and local traffic
regulations always take priority.
The Navigation system serves solely as an aid
to navigation. In particular, the Navigation
system cannot be used as an aid to orientation
when visibility is poor.
GPS signals may occasionally be interrupted
due to physical barriers, such as tunnels and
roads, under raised highways.
However, direction and speed sensors on the
vehicle will minimise any adverse effect on the
Navigation system. Normal operation will
resume once the obstruction has been passed.
Note: Some types of body-mounted accessories
(for example, external Luggage compartment
stowage devices) may affect the performance
of this system.
Under certain conditions, it is possible for the
vehicle's position shown on the screen to be
incorrect. This may happen:
•
When driving on a spiral ramp in a building.
•
When driving on or beneath elevated roads.
•
When two roads are close and parallel.
•
When the vehicle is transported to another
destination.
•
After the vehicle is rotated on a turntable.
•
After disconnection of the vehicle's battery.
USING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
From the Home menu, touch the Navigation
soft key (1). Alternatively, press the NAV button
on the fascia (2). A Caution screen will be
displayed.
