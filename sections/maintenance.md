# Maintenance

OWNER MAINTENANCE
Any significant or sudden drop in fluid
levels, or uneven tyre wear, should be
reported to a qualified technician without
delay.
This vehicle has a low kerb and ramp
clearance. Take care when approaching
low kerbs and steep ramps, as these
may cause damage to the lower parts of
the bumper.
In addition to the routine services and
inspections, a number of simple checks must
be carried out more frequently. These checks
can be carried out by the owner and advice is
given on the pages that follow.
DAILY CHECKS
•
Operation of the lamps, horn, direction
indicators, wipers, washers, and warning
indicators.
•
Operation of seat belts and brakes.
•
Look for fluid deposits underneath the
vehicle that might indicate a leak.
Condensation drips from the air
conditioning are normal.
WEEKLY CHECKS
•
Engine oil level.
•
Engine coolant level.
•
Brake fluid level.
•
Power steering fluid level.
•
Screen washer fluid level.
•
Tyre pressures and condition.
•
Operate air conditioning.
Note: The engine oil level should be checked
more frequently if the vehicle is driven for
prolonged periods at high speeds.
BRAKE PADS
It is recommended that brake pads should be
replaced when they reach a minimum thickness
of 3mm.

SAFETY IN THE GARAGE
If the vehicle has been driven recently,
do not touch exhaust and cooling
system components until the engine
has cooled.
Never leave the engine running in an
unventilated area.
Do not work beneath the vehicle with
a jack as the only means of support.
Keep your hands and clothing away
from drive belts, pulleys, and fans.
Some fans may continue to operate
after the engine has stopped.
Remove metal wristbands and
jewellery, before working in the engine
compartment.
Do not touch electrical leads or
components while the engine is
running, or with the starter switch
turned on.

Maintenance

Do not allow tools or metal parts of the
vehicle to make contact with the
battery leads or terminals.
FUEL SYSTEM
Under no circumstances should any
part of the fuel system be dismantled
or replaced by anyone other than a
suitably qualified vehicle technician.
Make sure sparks and naked lights are
kept away from the engine
compartment.
Wear protective clothing, including,
where practical, gloves made from an
impervious material.
USED ENGINE OIL
Prolonged contact with engine oil may
cause serious skin disorders, including
dermatitis and cancer of the skin. Always
wash thoroughly after contact.
OPENING THE BONNET
Do not attempt to open the bonnet if the
pedestrian protection system has
deployed.

1. Pull the bonnet release handle located in
   the left-side footwell.
2. Reach across to the centre rear edge of the
   bonnet and lift. The gas filled struts will
   assist raising the bonnet and retain it in the
   fully open position.

   Maintenance

CLOSING THE BONNET
Before closing the bonnet, make sure
that no-one is obstructing the closing
area and that hands and clothes are
clear.
When closing the bonnet, make sure that
you are standing in front of the vehicle.
Do not attempt to close the bonnet while
standing at the side of the vehicle, this
may result in incorrect latching of the
bonnet.
•
While standing in front of the vehicle, apply
a continuous, even pressure to both sides
of the bonnet in the positions shown, until
the bonnet is securely latched on both
sides.
•
Check that both latches are fully engaged
by attempting to lift both sides of the rear
outer-edge of the bonnet. This should be
free from all movement.
•
If the bonnet fails to latch securely on either
side, re-open the bonnet and repeat the
above procedure until both sides of the
bonnet are securely latched.
UNDER BONNET COVERS - REMOVAL

1. Rotate the turnbuckle screws
   counter-clockwise, then pull to remove the
   turnbuckles securing the cover.
2. Lift the front edge of the cover and slide
   forwards to remove.

   Maintenance

UNDER BONNET COVERS - REFITTING
Before refitting the under bonnet covers,
make sure that no pipes, cables, or other
items, have been trapped between the
cover and casing.

1. Place the cover over the casing and make
   sure the holes are aligned.
2. Press the cover down firmly and push the
   turnbuckles through the cover and casing.
   Rotate the turnbuckle screws clockwise to
   tighten.
   UNBLOCKING WASHER JETS
   Do not operate the washer jets during
   adjustment. Windscreen washer fluid
   may cause irritation to the eyes and
   skin. Always read and observe the
   washer fluid manufacturer's
   instructions.
   If a washer jet becomes blocked, use a thin
   strand of wire to unblock the jet by inserting the
   wire into the jet. Make sure that the wire is
   completely removed after unblocking.
   CHANGING A BULB
   Read the following warnings and cautions
   before changing a bulb.
   Always find a safe place to stop, off the
   road and away from traffic.
   Apply the Parking brake and engage
   Park (P).
   Make sure that all passengers and
   animals are out of the vehicle and in a
   safe place, away from the road.
   Place a warning triangle at a suitable
   distance behind the vehicle, facing
   towards oncoming traffic.
   If the vehicle has been driven recently,
   do not touch exhaust system
   components until they have cooled.
   If the lighting has just been switched
   off, give the bulbs time to cool.
   Handling them when hot may cause
   personal injury.
   Always replace bulbs with the correct
   type and specification, see 205, BULB
   SPECIFICATION. If you are in any doubt,
   contact a Dealer/Authorised Repairer for
   advice.
   Before attempting to replace a bulb,
   make sure that both the affected lamp
   and the vehicle’s ignition are turned off.
   If the circuit remains live, a short circuit
   can occur which may damage the
   vehicle’s electrical system.
   Only the following bulbs can be replaced:
   •
   Reversing lamp (3.0L vehicles only).
   •

Maintenance

REPAIRING MINOR PAINT DAMAGE
Regularly inspect the paintwork for damage.
Any stone chips, fractures, or deep scratches,
in the paint/bodywork should be repaired
promptly. Bare metal will corrode quickly, and
if left untreated can result in expensive repairs.
ALLOY WHEELS
Only use approved wheel cleaning
products.
THE EXTERIOR
Make sure the spoiler mechanism and
drainage holes are kept clean and free
of debris.
Never use cleaning products which are
not approved for use on vehicles.
Following cleaning of the vehicle
exterior, (particularly with a pressure
washer), it is recommended that the
vehicle is taken for a short drive in order
to dry out the brakes.
Some high pressure cleaning systems
are sufficiently powerful enough to
penetrate door and window seals, and
damage trim and door locks. Never aim
the water jet directly at the engine air
intake, heater air intakes, body seals, or
at any components which may be
damaged.
Some high pressure cleaning systems
are sufficiently powerful to damage the
wheels and brake system. Never aim a
water jet directly at the wheels or brakes.
Do not aim the water jet directly at any rubber
gaiters or seals on suspension joints.
Make sure that the water jet nozzle is more than
300 mm (11.8 in) away from vehicle
components.
Convertible roof:
Do not leave the convertible roof in the open
(folded) position for longer than is necessary,
as in certain circumstances, permanent soiling
along the folds may occur.
Cleaning: Every 1 600 km (1 000 miles) vacuum
clean and wash the convertible roof. Your
Dealer/Authorised Repairer will be able to
recommend suitable products.
Reproofing: Every 8 000 km (5 000 miles)
reproof the convertible roof material. Your
Dealer/Authorised Repairer will be able to
recommend suitable products.
PAINTWORK
Substances which are corrosive, such
as bird droppings, can damage the
vehicle's paintwork and should be
removed as soon as possible.
USING AN AUTOMATIC WASH
Make sure the Deployable Rear Spoiler
(DRS) is fully retracted before using a
car wash or a pressure washer. See 85,
SPOILER.
Make sure that the wipers are switched
off before entering a car wash. If the rain
sensitive wipers operate during the car
washing process, damage may occur to
the wiper mechanism. See 48, WIPER
OPERATION.
Commercially operated automatic car
washes, jet washes, and power-operated
mops, are not recommended.
Note: Regular use of automatic car washes
tends to dull the lustre of the paintwork.
After leaving the car wash, switch on the
windscreen wipers immediately, to remove
water and prevent a build up of wax.
