ENSEMBLES
Unlike AM/FM radio, DAB transmits several
channels/stations on a single frequency. A
group of channels is known as an ensemble.
Some channels within the ensemble may have
subchannels offering several listening options.
If reception is lost when the vehicle is in motion,
the vehicle may be out of range of the ensemble.
To build a new list of ensembles, select
Auto-tune.
