# Portable media

•
Auxiliary device (personal audio, MP3
players, all iPods).
Note: Auxiliary devices have no Touch
screen control.
If you are connecting an iPod, mass storage, or
Bluetooth® device, use the Touch screen to
operate and search the device. Many of the
controls are similar to those available for CD
play.
Please disconnect your iPod when
leaving the vehicle. Failure to do so may
result in the iPod battery discharging.
Note: The Audio system will play MP3, WMA,
and AAC files.
To maximise playback quality, it is
recommended that lossless compression is
used for any media files on USB or iPod. Failing
this, it is recommended that compressed files
utilise a minimum bitrate of 192 kb/s (a higher
bitrate is strongly recommended).
Note: iPod is a trademark of Apple Computer
Inc., registered in the US and other countries.
Note: Some MP3 players have their own file
system that is not supported by this system. To
use your MP3 player, you must set it to USB
Removable Device or Mass Storage Device
mode. Only music that has been added to the
device in this mode can be played.
CONNECTING A DEVICE

1. USB socket.
2. 3.5 mm AUX socket.
   Connect the device into the appropriate socket.
   Note: Use the cable supplied with your media
   device to connect to the USB socket.
   When an iPod is connected, playback will
   continue from the point at which it was last
   playing, provided the iPod battery is in a good
   state of charge.
   When a USB device is connected, playback will
   start from the first track in the first available
   folder. If a device is connected when My music
   is selected, playback will continue from the point
   at which it was last playing.
   Do not plug non-audio devices into the
   USB port.
   Note: A USB hub cannot be used to connect
   more than one USB device to the audio unit.
   Note: Devices connected to the USB ports will
   be charged, but devices that are fully discharged
   will not play.

   Portable media

Note: Options, such as Repeat and Mix, relate
to the device currently playing; they will not
apply to any subsequent device.
The 3.5mm AUX socket allows additional
equipment (e.g., personal stereo MP3 player,
hand-held navigation unit, etc.) to be connected
to the Audio system.
Note: iPod shuffle may be connected via the
AUX socket.
PLAYING A PORTABLE DEVICE
If you are using a USB mass storage device or
approved iPod, you can control playback using
the Touch screen controls.
If you are using a Bluetooth® device, you can
control playback using the Touch screen, but
some controls are unavailable.
If you are using any portable media device via
the AUX socket, then you must control playback
from the device itself.
Jaguar does not recommend the use of
a Hard Disc Drive via the USB link while
the vehicle is in motion. These devices
are not designed for in-car use and may
be damaged.
CONNECTING MULTIPLE DEVICES
Do not plug non-audio devices into the
USB port.
You can connect multiple devices
simultaneously to the portable media interface
and switch between them using the Touch
screen. Select iPod, USB, Bluetooth, or AUX,
to switch between modes.
The device docked first will remain the active
device until you choose to change.
If, after changing to the newly-docked device,
you change back to the first device, play will
resume at the point you left it (USB and iPod
only).
Note: You cannot use a USB hub to connect
more than one USB device to the audio unit.
Note: Devices connected to the iPod and USB
ports will be charged, but devices that are fully
discharged will not play.
Note: Options, such as Repeat and Shuffle,
relate to the device currently playing; they will
not apply to any subsequent device.

Touch the preview to view that channel.
Note: As the TV system is continually
checking the availability of channels, it is
possible for a channel to be in the list, but
not actually available (e.g., when driving
through different transmitter regions).
Note: After a country format change, the
channel list will be empty until the system
has scanned all channels at least once. 7. TV channel presets:
