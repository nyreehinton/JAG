DYNAMIC STABILITY CONTROL (DSC)
DSC is unable to compensate for driver
misjudgement. It remains the driver's
responsibility to drive with due care
and attention, in a manner which is
safe for the vehicle, its occupants, and
the other road users.
DSC optimises vehicle stability, even in critical
driving situations. The system controls dynamic
stability when accelerating and when starting
from a standstill. Additionally, it identifies
unstable driving behaviour, such as understeer
and oversteer, and helps to keep the vehicle
under control by manipulating the engine output
and applying the brakes at individual wheels.
Note: Some noise may be generated when the
brakes are applied.
When engaged, DSC will constantly
communicate with various vehicle management
systems to monitor the behaviour of the vehicle.
If necessary, it will engage and operate the
required system(s) to help maintain control of
the vehicle's dynamic stability.
These management systems include:
•
Engine.
•
Transmission.
•
Brakes.
•
Steering.
•
Suspension.
SWITCHING DSC OFF
Press and hold the DSC switch for more than
3 seconds.
•
The Message centre will display DSC Off
and a short warning chime will sound.
•
The DSC Off warning lamp in the Instrument
panel will illuminate. See 40, DYNAMIC
STABILITY CONTROL (DSC) (AMBER).
SWITCHING DSC ON
Press the DSC switch for 1 second and then
release.
The DSC system will switch on, the Message
centre will temporarily display DSC On.
Note: Switching the engine off and then on
again, will always revert DSC status to DSC On,
regardless of which mode is selected.
TRACDSC
Vehicle safety may be reduced by
inappropriate use of TracDSC. TracDSC
should only be used in suitable
conditions.
