# Stability control

TracDSC is an alternative setting of DSC, with
reduced system interventions. With TracDSC
engaged, traction may be increased, although
stability may be reduced compared to normal
DSC. TracDSC is intended for use only on dry
tarmac, by suitably experienced drivers.
TracDSC should not be selected for other
surfaces or by drivers with insufficient skill and
training to operate the vehicle safely with the
TracDSC function engaged.
Press and hold the DSC switch for 1 second
and then release.
SWITCHING BETWEEN DSC AND
TRACDSC
Press and hold the DSC switch for less than
seconds. The Message centre will temporarily
display either TracDSC or DSC On.
The DSC Off warning lamp will illuminate when
TracDSC is active.
Note: Cruise control will automatically be
disengaged.
JAGUARDRIVE CONTROL
The JaguarDrive control switch is located on
the driver's side of the centre console, next to
the gear selector. See 234, DRIVER CONTROLS.
Note: The switch lever will always return to the
centre position when released, regardless of the
mode selection.

1. Move the switch lever to the Rain/Ice/Snow
   mode position to engage. Repeat this action
   to disengage. See 82, RAIN/ICE/SNOW
   MODE.
2. Move the switch lever to the Dynamic mode
   position to engage. Repeat this action to
   disengage. See 82, DYNAMIC MODE.
   When Rain/Ice/Snow mode or Dynamic mode
   is engaged, the relevant switch lamp will remain
   illuminated.
   When Rain/Ice/Snow mode or Dynamic mode
   is disengaged, the relevant switch lamp will
   extinguish.
   RAIN/ICE/SNOW MODE
   Rain/Ice/Snow mode optimises
   stability of the vehicle to suit low
   grip conditions. This helps the
   vehicle to perform in a more gentle
   and controlled manner, to avoid
   skidding, allowing more confident
   progress under adverse conditions.
   Note: Rain/Ice/Snow mode cannot be active at
   the same time as Dynamic mode.
   Note: Rain/Ice/Snow mode will remain selected
   indefinitely, even after the ignition is switched
   off. Rain/Ice/Snow mode must be deselected,
   if no longer required.
   DYNAMIC MODE
   Dynamic mode coordinates the
   vehicle's control systems to deliver
   a high performance driving
   experience.
   Note: Dynamic mode cannot be active at the
   same time as Rain/Ice/Snow mode.

   Stability control

Note: Dynamic mode will remain selected for
approximately 6 hours after the ignition is
switched off, after which point it will need to be
selected again, if required.
Note: When the transmission is set to
permanent manual mode and Dynamic mode
is selected, transmission upshifts are fully
controlled by the driver. The transmission will
not change up automatically, even when the rev
limit is reached (the gear position indicator in
the Message centre will glow amber, to indicate
that the next gear should be selected).

DYNAMIC LAUNCH
Dynamic launch enhances vehicle acceleration
and automatic gear changes during launch.
To activate:

1. Make sure that:
   •
   The vehicle is stationary.
   •
   The engine is running.
   •
   The steering is in the straight ahead
   position.
   •
   Dynamic mode is engaged. See 82,
   JAGUARDRIVE CONTROL.
2. Press the brake pedal and hold with the left
   foot.
3. Select either Drive (D) or Sport (S). See 78,
   AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION.
4. Using the right foot, lightly press the
   accelerator pedal until the Message centre
   displays DYNAMIC LAUNCH READY.
5. Release the brake pedal, then quickly press
   the accelerator pedal to the kickdown
   position. The Message centre will display
   DYNAMIC LAUNCH ACTIVE.
   Note: Any manual gear selection, from the gear
   selector or steering wheel gearshift paddles,
   will override the Dynamic launch operation.
   Dynamic launch will remain available for further
   use after a short period of time.
   Note: Dynamic launch will not be active when
   the accelerator pedal is released from a high
   demand position.
   Prolonged application of the brake pedal will
   deactivate Dynamic launch.
   Note: Dynamic launch is not fitted to all
   derivatives.

    SPOILER
    Make sure the Deployable Rear Spoiler
    (DRS) is fully retracted before using a
    car wash or a pressure washer.
    If a fault is detected in the DRS system, then
    the message SPOILER NOT AVAILABLE will be
    displayed in the Message centre. In some cases,
    the DRS system may reset by switching the
    ignition off for a few seconds and switching on
    again. If the message is still displayed, drive
    with caution and seek assistance from a
    Dealer/Authorised Repairer as soon as possible.
    Regularly check and clean the DRS housing and
    drainage areas.
    When driving in adverse conditions, make sure
    that the DRS is clear of obstructions (for
    example, ice, snow, leaves, etc.). Manually
    check the operation of the DRS before each
    journey.
    Do not attach or apply any loads to the DRS (for
    example, bicycle carrier, luggage rack, signs,
    etc.).
    Note: Continuous operation of the DRS may
    cause the system to overheat and cease
    operation. If this occurs allow sufficient time
    for the system to cool.
    Automatic mode (Convertible only)
    The DRS will automatically deploy when the
    vehicle reaches a speed of 96 km/h (60 mph).
    The DRS will automatically retract if the
    vehicle's speed is below 64 km/h (40 mph).
    Automatic mode (Coupe only)
    The DRS will automatically deploy when the
    vehicle reaches a speed of 113 km/h (70 mph).
    The DRS will retract if the vehicle's speed is
    below 80 km/h (50 mph).
    Manual mode
    Press the switch to manually deploy the DRS
    at speeds below 96 km/h (60 mph) on the
    Convertible, 113 km/h (70 mph) on the Coupe.
    The switch will illuminate to confirm.
    Note: The DRS can also be manually deployed
    when the vehicle is stationary, for maintenance.
    Note: The DRS will not automatically retract
    when in manual mode. It is advisable to return
    the DRS to automatic mode, when manual mode
    is no longer required.
    Press the switch again to return to automatic
    mode. The switch lamp will extinguish to
    confirm. The DRS will retract if the vehicle's
    speed is below 64 km/h (40 mph) on the
    Convertible, 80 km/h (50 mph) on the Coupe.
    Note: If the vehicle is stationary, or the vehicle's
    speed is below 21 km/h (13 mph), the switch
    must be continually pressed until the DRS is
    fully retracted. If the retraction is aborted, then
    release the switch and press again to return to
    the fully deployed position.

    Stability control

Note: Manual retraction of the DRS is available
for up to 40 seconds after the ignition has been
switched off.
ACTIVE DIFFERENTIAL CONTROL
The Active differential control (E-diff) improves
traction on uneven road surfaces and can also
improve stability in oversteer situations.
If the warning message EDIFF SYSTEM FAULT
is displayed and DSC is off, then TracDSC will
be automatically selected. The vehicle can still
be driven and DSC modes can be selected, but
seek qualified assistance as soon as possible.
If the warning message EDIFF NOT AVAILABLE
is displayed, the system has temporarily shut
down to prevent overheating. The vehicle can
still be driven and the E-diff will be operational
again when the system has cooled sufficiently.
During the first 1 600 km (1 000 miles):
•
Avoid full throttle applications and do not
exceed 190 km/h (120 mph). Observe the
national speed limits in the country in which
you are travelling.
•
Avoid prolonged periods in excess of
km/h (100 mph).
During the first 8 000 km (5 000 miles):
•
Do not exceed 250 km/h (155 mph).
•
Do not participate in motor racing events,
track days, sports driving schools, or
similar.

ADAPTIVE DYNAMICS
If the general warning lamp illuminates (see 38,
GENERAL WARNING/INFORMATION MESSAGE
(AMBER)) and the message ADAPTIVE
DYNAMICS FAULT is displayed in the Message
centre, some reduction in ride comfort may be
experienced. If the fault persists, consult a
Dealer/Authorised Repairer.
