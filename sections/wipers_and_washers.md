EXTERIOR MIRRORS

1. Left mirror adjustment.
2. Right mirror adjustment.
3. Power-fold/unfold: Press both buttons
   simultaneously. This feature is inhibited at
   speeds over 110 km/h (70 mph).
   The mirrors can be adjusted and folded when
   the ignition is on and for up to 5 minutes after
   the ignition is switched off, provided the driverâ€™s
   door is not opened.
   Press the appropriate button to select the mirror
   to be adjusted (button indicator illuminates),
   then use the joystick control to adjust the mirror
   glass.
   Note: Depending on the type of lens used,
   distances may be difficult to judge accurately
   when only using the mirrors.
   The mirrors can be configured to
   automatically fold when the vehicle
   is locked and unfold when unlocked.
   This feature can be enabled or
   disabled by your Dealer/Authorised
   Repairer.
   If the mirrors are accidentally knocked out of
   position (i.e., so only one is folded), press both
   buttons simultaneously to resynchronise.
   Note: If the mirrors were folded using the
   switches, they will not unfold when the vehicle
   is unlocked.
   Note: Up to 3 different exterior mirror positions
   can be stored and recalled using the Driving
   position memory feature. See 21, DRIVING
   POSITION MEMORY.

MIRROR DIP WHEN REVERSING
The mirrors can be configured so that when
Reverse (R) gear is selected, the passenger door
mirror is automatically adjusted to provide an
improved viewing angle for reversing.
The exact dipped position can be adjusted using
the joystick control, when the mirror is dipped.
The next time Reverse (R) is selected, the newly
adjusted position will be selected.
When the gear selector is moved out of Reverse
(R), or if the vehicle's speed exceeds 12 km/h
(7.5 mph) while reversing, the mirror will return
to its previous position.
Mirror dip can be selected or deselected from
the Instrument panel menu. Select Features
from the Vehicle Set-up menu, then select the
desired option from the list.
