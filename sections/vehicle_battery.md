# Vehicle battery

Your vehicle battery will be either:

1. Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM) battery. These
   are sealed for life and require no
   maintenance.
   Do not attempt to open or remove the
   top from an AGM battery.
2. Low maintenance battery. The battery cells’
   electrolyte levels can be checked and topped
   up.
   Remove the Luggage compartment, left-side
   cover to access the battery.
   In hot climates, more frequent checks of the
   battery electrolyte level and condition are
   required. If necessary, the battery cells can be
   topped up using distilled water.
   BATTERY MONITORING SYSTEM
   If excessive battery discharge occurs, the
   Intelligent Power System Management (IPSM)
   will begin to shut down non-essential electrical
   systems to protect battery power.
   If the message Energy Management is
   displayed on the Touch screen while the engine
   is switched off, after 3 minutes, IPSM will begin
   a shut down operation. Normal system function
   will resume when the engine is started.
   If the message Low Battery - Please Start
   Engine is displayed on the Touch screen and in
   the Message centre while the engine is switched
   off, after 3 minutes, IPSM will begin a shut
   down operation. The Message centre will
   continue to display the message until either the
   vehicle is completely turned off or the engine
   is started. Normal system function will resume
   when the engine is started.
   Note: If the message Low Battery - Please Start
   Engine is displayed, drive the vehicle for at least
   30 minutes in temperatures above 0°C (32°F)
   or at least 60 minutes if temperatures are below
   0°C (32°F). This will allow the battery to recover
   to an acceptable level.
   CONNECTING JUMP LEADS
   Always wear appropriate eye protection
   when working with batteries.
   Do not disconnect the discharged
   battery.
   Do not connect a jump lead to any
   battery terminal on your vehicle.
   Make sure the bodywork of the donor
   and disabled vehicles do not touch.
   Make sure both batteries are of the
   12-volt type and that the jump leads
   have insulated clamps and are
   approved for use with 12-volt batteries.
   Note: Before connecting jump leads, make sure
   that all electrical equipment on the disabled and
   donor vehicles have been switched off.

3. Connect the positive jump lead (red) to the
   recommended positive boost terminal on
   the donor vehicle.
   Refer to the donor vehicle's handbook.
4. On your vehicle, release the access cover
   and remove the positive boost terminal
   cover. Connect the other end of the positive
   jump lead (red) to the positive boost
   terminal, as illustrated.
5. Connect the negative jump lead (black) to
   the recommended negative boost terminal
   of the donor vehicle.
   Refer to the donor vehicle's handbook.
6. Connect the other end of the negative jump
   lead (black) to your vehicle's negative boost
   terminal, as illustrated.
   Check that all of the cables are clear of
   any moving components and that all
   connections are secure.
7. Start the engine of the donor vehicle and
   allow it to idle for a few minutes.
8. Start the engine of the disabled vehicle.
   If repeated attempts to start the disabled
   vehicle are needed, allow the donor vehicle
   to idle for a few minutes between attempts.
9. Allow both vehicles to idle for 2 minutes.
10. Switch off the donor vehicle.

DISCONNECTING JUMP LEADS
To avoid serious injury, use extreme
caution when removing the jump leads,
as the engine will be running on the
previously disabled vehicle. This
means that you may be working close
to components which are moving at
high speed, carry high voltage, or may
be hot.
Note: Do not switch on any electrical equipment
until after the cables have been disconnected.
The engine should be running on the previously
disabled vehicle and the engine switched off on
the donor vehicle. Disconnect the jump leads
in the exact reverse order of that used for
connection.
CONNECTING A STARTING AID
Do not connect the starting aid to any
battery terminal on your vehicle. Doing
so may cause a spark, which can result
in an explosion. It may also result in
damage to the charging system.
To start the vehicle using a starting aid or a
slave battery, follow the instructions in the
sequence given:

1. Connect the positive (Red) cable to the
   positive boost terminal of the disabled
   vehicle. See 160, CONNECTING JUMP
   LEADS.
2. Connect the negative (Black) cable to the
   negative boost terminal of the disabled
   vehicle.
3. Connect/switch on the starting aid.
4. Start the engine and allow it to idle.
5. Disconnect/switch off the starting aid.
6. Disconnect the negative (Black) cable from
   the negative boost terminal of the vehicle.
   See 162, DISCONNECTING JUMP LEADS.
7. Disconnect the positive (Red) cable from
   the positive boost terminal of the vehicle.
   CHARGING THE VEHICLE BATTERY
   The battery must be disconnected and
   removed from the vehicle before
   charging.
   Battery disconnection, removal, and
   replacement, should only be carried out
   by qualified personnel. Consult your
   Dealer/Authorised Repairer.
   REPLACING THE VEHICLE BATTERY
   Battery disconnection, removal, and
   replacement, should only be carried out
   by qualified personnel. Consult your
   Dealer/Authorised Repairer.
   Used batteries must be disposed of
   correctly, as they contain a number
   of harmful substances. Seek advice
   from your Dealer/Authorised
   Repairer and/or your local authority.

   Fuses

CHANGING A FUSE
Always turn off the ignition system and
the affected electrical circuit, before
replacing a fuse.
Fit Jaguar approved replacement fuses
of the same rating and type, or fuses of
a matching specification.
If the replacement fuse blows after
installation, the system should be
checked by a Dealer/Authorised
Repairer.
Note: Jaguar recommend that owners do not
remove or replace relays. It is recommended
that you seek qualified assistance in the event
of a relay failure.
Spare fuses and the fuse removal tool are
located in the passenger side footwell fuse box.
See 168, PASSENGER COMPARTMENT FUSE
BOX.
