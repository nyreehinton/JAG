WHEEL CHANGING
Carbon ceramic brake discs are
susceptible to damage. Take care not to
damage the brake discs when removing
and refitting the road wheels.
Vehicles with carbon ceramic brake
discs are supplied with 2 wheel guide
pins. The pins are stored with the
compressor in the tyre repair kit, see
186, TYRE REPAIR KIT. Make sure that
the 2 wheel guide pins are used to aid
removing and refitting of road wheels
on vehicles with carbon ceramic brake
discs.
Note: Vehicles with a convertible roof do not
facilitate stowage of a full size wheel and tyre.
Open the Luggage compartment lid, see 10,
OPENING AND CLOSING THE LUGGAGE
COMPARTMENT.

1. Spare wheel retaining bolt and clamp.
2. Jack: Observe the instructions printed on
   the jack.
3. Wheel brace.
4. Wheel chock.
   To remove the spare wheel and tool tray,
   unscrew and remove the retaining bolt and
   clamp (1).
   Before raising the vehicle, use the wheel nut
   brace to slacken the wheel nuts half a turn
   counter-clockwise.
   Note: The locking wheel nut adaptor will be
   required to slacken and remove the locking
   wheel nut. The locking wheel nut adaptor is
   located next to the vehicle's battery, see 192,
   LOCKING WHEEL NUTS.
   There are 4 jacking points on the underside of
   the floor. Two indented, triangular indicators
   are provided on each sill cover. These indicate
   the location for the jack.
   Raise the vehicle with the jack until the tyre
   being lifted just clears the ground. Operate the
   jack with a slow and steady motion. Avoid
   sudden and erratic actions as they may cause
   the vehicle/jack to become unstable.

   Wheel changing

On vehicles with carbon ceramic brake discs,
remove 2 opposing wheel nuts and install the
2 wheel guide pins, as shown.
Remove the remaining wheel nuts and carefully
remove the road wheel.
Note: To remove the centre badge, use the
plastic tipped end of the wheel nut wrench
handle, push the centre badge from its housing
from the inside of the wheel.
Do not remove the two wheel guide pins
from the vehicle until the wheel has been
lightly tightened with 3 wheel nuts.
Using the wheel nut wrench, lightly tighten the
wheel nuts alternately, using the sequence
shown in the illustration.
Lower the jack, then tighten the wheel nuts fully,
in the same sequence shown. Do not
overtighten by using foot pressure or extension
bars on the wheel nut wrench.
At the earliest opportunity, have the wheel nuts
tightened with a torque wrench to 125 Nm (92
lb.ft).
This torque must not be exceeded.
LOCKING WHEEL NUTS
The locking wheel nut adaptor is located in the
Luggage compartment, next to the vehicle's
battery. To access the locking wheel nut
adaptor, remove the Luggage compartment left
side (battery) cover.
Locking wheel nuts can be removed and
installed using only the special adaptor provided
in the tool kit.
Note: When the vehicle is first supplied, the
adaptor may be stored in the glove
compartment. It should be removed and stored
in the position shown, as soon as possible.

Note: A code number is stamped onto the
underside of the adaptor. This number should
be recorded in the Service Portfolio, supplied
with the literature pack. If a replacement adaptor
is required, you will be asked to quote this
number.
IMPORTANT – USE OF SPARE TYRE
Observe the following warnings before using
the temporary spare wheel:
Adhere to the instructions on the
temporary spare warning label, affixed
to the wheel. This may cause vehicle
instability and/or tyre failure.
Where fitted the temporary-use spare
wheel is FOR TEMPORARY USE ONLY.
Drive with caution while the temporary
spare wheel is fitted. Make sure that
an original size wheel and tyre are
fitted as soon as possible.
Do not fit more than one temporary
spare wheel.
Do not exceed 80 km/h (50 mph) while
the temporary spare wheel is fitted.
The tyre pressure in the temporary
spare wheel should be 4.2 bar (60
psi/420 kPa).
Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) must
be switched on while the temporary
spare wheel is in use.
Traction devices, such as snow chains,
cannot be used with a temporary spare
wheel.

TOWING EYES
The towing eye at the front of the
vehicle is designed for on-road
recovery only.
Do not tow the vehicle on all 4 wheels.
ATTACHING THE FRONT TOWING EYE
The front towing eye is located in the Luggage
compartment, along the right side of the
vehicle's battery. To access the front towing
eye, remove the Luggage compartment left-side
(battery) cover.

1. Pop out the access cover in the front
   bumper.
2. Locate the towing eye through the bumper
   and screw the towing eye counter-clockwise
   into its fixing, until secure.

   Vehicle recovery

TRANSMISSION PARK RELEASE
Make sure that the vehicle is secured
with wheel chocks, apply the Electric
Parking Brake (EPB), or firmly press
the brake pedal. Failure to do so can
result in unexpected movement of the
vehicle, causing serious injury or
death.
When recovering your vehicle, it may be
necessary to manually release the transmission
from the Park (P) position to the Neutral (N)
position. The Transmission park release is
operated by a lever located in the cubby box,
see 65, STORAGE COMPARTMENTS.
To operate the Transmission park release:

1. Remove the left side trim panel.
2. Rotate the Transmission park release
   locking device 90° counter-clockwise.
3. Pull the operating lever until it is latched in
   the vertical position.
   To re-engage the transmission park lock:
   •
   Hold the strap on the operating lever (4),
   and release the latch (5).
   •
   Return the operating lever to the horizontal
   position.
   •
   Rotate the Transmission park release
   locking device 90° clockwise.
   •
   Install the trim panel and close the cubby
   box.
   TRANSPORTING THE VEHICLE
   Only use the lashing points or
   over-wheel lashings. Lashing over the
   body or suspension is not permissible
   as settling of the suspension will cause
   the lashing straps to slacken.
   The recommended method for
   recovery/transportation of the vehicle, is on a
   transporter or trailer designed for that purpose.
   Make sure that transportation is carried out by
   suitably qualified persons, and that the vehicle
   is secured correctly.
   To allow the vehicle to roll freely, the
   transmission will need to be released from Park
   (P) via the use of the Transmission park release.

   Vehicle recovery

If possible, make sure that the
Deployable Rear Spoiler (DRS) is in the
fully stowed position.
