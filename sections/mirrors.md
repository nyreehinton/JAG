BLIND SPOT MONITOR
The Blind Spot Monitor (BSM) system
is a supplement to, not a replacement
for, a safe driving style and use of the
exterior and rear-view mirrors.
Please note that BSM may not be able
to give adequate warning of vehicles
approaching very quickly from behind
or vehicles that are being overtaken
rapidly.
BSM may not be able to detect all
vehicles and may also detect objects,
such as roadside barriers, etc.
The radar sensors may be impaired by
mud, rain, frost, ice, snow, or road
spray. This may affect the system's
ability to reliably detect a
vehicle/object within the blind spot.
Make sure that the warning indicators
in the exterior mirrors are not obscured
by stickers or other objects.
Do not attach stickers or objects to the
rear bumpers, that may interfere with
the radar sensors.
The Blind Spot Monitor (BSM) system monitors
a zone that covers the area adjacent to the
vehicle, that is not easily visible by the driver
and is designed to identify any object overtaking
the vehicle. The system uses a radar on each
side of the vehicle to identify any overtaking
vehicle/object within the blind spot area of the
vehicle, while disregarding other objects which
may be stationary or travelling in the opposite
direction, etc.
The radar monitors the area extending from the
exterior mirror rearwards, to approximately
metres (20 feet) behind the rear wheels, and up
to 2.5 metres (8.2 feet) from the side of the
vehicle (the width of a typical carriageway lane).
If an object is identified by the system as being
an overtaking vehicle/object, an amber warning
icon (1) illuminates in the relevant exterior
mirror, to alert the driver that there is a potential
hazard in the vehicle's blind spot and; therefore,
that a lane change might be dangerous.
Note: This radar sensor is approved in all RTTE
countries.
