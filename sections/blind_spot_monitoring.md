## Overview

Blind Spot Monitoring (BSM) is an advanced driver assistance system designed to enhance safety by detecting vehicles in the driver's blind spots and providing timely warnings.

### System Coverage

**Note:** The system covers an area of a fixed lane width. If the lanes are narrower than a typical carriageway lane, objects travelling in non-adjacent lanes may be detected.

---

## System Operation

### Activation Conditions

BSM automatically switches on and becomes active when the vehicle is travelling at more than **10 km/h (6 mph)** in a forward gear.

### System Initialization

When the system initiates, it performs a self-check, during which the warning icons in the mirrors illuminate alternately for a short period of time. The indicator dot remains illuminated until forward vehicle speed exceeds 10 km/h (6 mph).

### Deactivation Conditions

BSM is automatically turned off when:

- **Reverse (R)** gear is selected
- The vehicle is in **Park (P)**
- The vehicle is travelling below **5 km/h (3 mph)**

Under these conditions, an amber warning indicator within the exterior mirror is displayed.

### Optimal Performance

BSM is designed to work most effectively when driving on **multi-lane highways**.

---

## Closing Vehicle Sensing

### System Purpose

Closing vehicle sensing is a **supplement to, not a replacement for**, a safe driving style and use of the exterior and rear-view mirrors.

### Important Limitations

**WARNING:** Closing vehicle sensing may not be able to give adequate warning of vehicles approaching very quickly from directly behind the vehicle. **Always use the exterior and rear-view mirrors.**

### Environmental Factors

The radar sensors may be impaired by:

- Mud
- Rain
- Frost
- Ice
- Snow
- Road spray

This may affect the system's ability to reliably detect an approaching vehicle.

### Maintenance Requirements

- **Make sure** that the warning indicators in the exterior mirrors are not obscured by stickers or other objects
- **Do not attach** stickers or objects to the rear bumpers that may interfere with the radar sensors

### Operating Conditions

Closing vehicle sensing is designed to perform best on multi-lane motorways with free-flowing traffic and is operational above **13 km/h (8 mph)** in a forward gear.

### Detection Process

1. **Closing vehicle sensing** monitors an area behind the vehicle, up to a distance of 60 metres (197 ft) and approximately 2.5 metres (8 ft) from each side of the vehicle (the width of a typical carriageway lane)

2. **If a vehicle is detected approaching rapidly**, an amber warning icon will flash in the relevant exterior mirror to indicate that there is a potential danger

3. **When the detected vehicle reaches the area monitored by the BSM**, the amber warning icon will illuminate continuously

### Special Conditions

**Note:** If rapidly overtaking vehicles are detected on both sides simultaneously, the warning icons in both mirrors will flash.

**Note:** The system covers an area of a fixed lane width. If the lanes are narrower than a typical carriageway lane, objects travelling in non-adjacent lanes may be detected.

**Note:** Closing vehicle sensing is disabled when the vehicle is negotiating a tight radius curve.

**Note:** When BSM is disabled, Closing vehicle sensing is also disabled.

**Note:** This radar sensor is approved in all RTTE countries.

---

## BSM Sensors

### Sensor Blockage Detection

The BSM system will automatically disable if either of the sensors become completely obscured. When this occurs:

- An amber warning indicator dot is displayed in the exterior mirror
- The message **"BLIND SPOT MONITOR SENSOR BLOCKED"** appears in the Message centre

### Blockage Testing

**Note:** Blockage testing is only initiated when the vehicle's speed is above 10 km/h (6 mph) and will take at least 2 minutes of accumulated driving above this speed to determine that the sensor is blocked.

### Sensor Maintenance

If the sensors become blocked, please check that:

- There is nothing obscuring the rear bumper
- The bumper is clear from ice, frost, and dirt

### System Faults

If a fault with one of the radar sensors is detected:

- An amber warning indicator dot is displayed in the exterior mirror
- The message **"BLIND SPOT MONITOR NOT AVAILABLE"** is displayed in the Message centre

**Note:** Even if the detected fault only affects the radar sensor on one side of the vehicle, the whole system is disabled. If the fault is temporary, the system will operate correctly once the engine has been switched off and then on again.

### Professional Assistance

If a fault in the system occurs, consult your Dealer/Authorised Repairer.

---

## System Controls

### Enabling/Disabling BSM

BSM can be enabled or disabled through the Instrument panel menu. See [Instrument Panel Menu](#instrument-panel-menu) for detailed instructions.

### Multiple Vehicle Detection

**Note:** If an overtaking vehicle is detected on both sides of the vehicle simultaneously, the warning icons in both mirrors will illuminate.

---

## Safety Information

### Critical Safety Reminders

- **Always use** exterior and rear-view mirrors as your primary means of observation
- **Do not rely solely** on the BSM system for vehicle detection
- **Maintain proper** driving techniques and situational awareness
- **Check blind spots** manually before changing lanes

### System Limitations

- The system may not detect all vehicles in all conditions
- Environmental factors can affect sensor performance
- The system is designed for highway use and may not work optimally in all driving scenarios
- Always verify it is safe to change lanes before making the maneuver

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### System Not Working

1. **Check sensor cleanliness** - Ensure rear bumper sensors are clean and unobstructed
2. **Verify system activation** - Confirm BSM is enabled in the instrument panel menu
3. **Check vehicle speed** - System only operates above 10 km/h (6 mph)
4. **Inspect warning indicators** - Look for amber warning dots in exterior mirrors

#### False Alarms

1. **Clean sensors** - Remove any dirt, ice, or debris from the rear bumper
2. **Check for obstructions** - Ensure no objects are blocking the radar sensors
3. **Verify lane width** - System may detect vehicles in adjacent lanes on narrow roads

#### System Disabled

1. **Check for fault messages** - Look for warning messages in the Message centre
2. **Restart vehicle** - Switch engine off and on to reset temporary faults
3. **Seek professional help** - Contact Dealer/Authorised Repairer for persistent issues

### Professional Service

If the system continues to malfunction after basic troubleshooting:

- Contact your Dealer/Authorised Repairer
- Do not attempt to repair or modify the system yourself
- Ensure all maintenance is performed by qualified technicians

STARTING THE ENGINE
Never start the engine, or leave it
running, when the vehicle is in an
enclosed space. Exhaust gases are
poisonous and can cause
unconsciousness and death, if inhaled.
If the engine fails to start, do not
continue cranking as this will discharge
the battery. It may also damage the
catalytic converter due to unburnt fuel
passing through the exhaust.
Note: The Smart key may not be detected if it
is placed within a metal container, or if it is
shielded by a device with a back-lit LCD screen
such as a smart phone, laptop (including when
inside a laptop bag), game console, etc. Keep
the Smart key clear of such devices when
attempting Keyless entry or Keyless starting.

ENGINE BLOCK HEATERS
The fitting of an engine block heater
does not eliminate the need for
antifreeze.
Engines are more difficult to start when the
ambient temperature is very low. In
geographical areas where temperatures below

- 10°C (14°F) are experienced frequently, it is
  advisable to fit an engine block heater. The block
  heater will have an insulated connector at the
  front of the vehicle, which is connected to a
  mains supply using a suitable extension cable.
  The heater can remain in use overnight, if
  required. Typically, an engine block heater will
  use between 0.4 and 1 kWh.
  For further information, consult a
  Dealer/Authorised Repairer.

INTELLIGENT STOP/START
The Intelligent stop/start system is designed to
improve fuel efficiency and is automatically
activated when the ignition is turned on. If the
vehicle is stopped (e.g., at traffic lights or in
traffic) the engine will turn off (unless it is
required to support other vehicle systems).
When the brake pedal is released and a drive
gear is selected, the engine will restart
automatically.
During operation of the Intelligent stop/start
system, a warning lamp will illuminate, see 41,
INTELLIGENT STOP/START (GREEN).
To activate an automatic engine stop:

appropriate LED indicator lamp, on top of the
gear selector, will illuminate to confirm
selection.
Note: When the gear selector is released, after
normal operation, it will return to the central
position, except for when in the Sport (S)
position.
Park (P) should only be engaged when
the vehicle is stationary. If any other
gear position is selected while the
vehicle is stationary, the vehicle can
move unexpectedly, which may result
in death or serious injury. Always make
sure the Parking brake is applied after
engaging P.
Never select P while the vehicle is in
motion. Doing so can result in serious
transmission damage.
Note: P cannot be selected by manually moving
the gear selector.

1. Press to select Park (P). The P LED
   indicator lamp will illuminate to confirm.
   Select P before switching off the engine.
   Note: P can be selected from any gear
   selector position.
   Note: If the engine is switched off with
   Neutral (N) selected, the system will wait
   for 10 minutes before selecting P. This
   procedure is to allow the vehicle to be
   conveyed through a car wash only and
   should not be used for vehicle recovery
   purposes. See 195, TRANSPORTING THE
   VEHICLE.

2. When the vehicle is stationary, press the
   brake pedal prior to selecting Drive (D),
   Neutral (N), or Reverse (R).
3. With the brake pedal still applied, press the
   release button to allow the gear selector to
   be moved:
   •
   A rearward movement to select D.
   •
   A short forward movement to select N.
   •
   A longer forward movement to select
   R.
   Never select R while the vehicle is in
   forward motion. Doing so can result in
   serious transmission damage.
   Never select a forward gear while the
   vehicle is moving backwards. Doing so
   can result in serious transmission
   damage.
   Note: The release button is required for all
   gear selections, except for when selecting
   N from D or R and selecting S from D or D
   from S.
4. While in D, move the gear selector one side
   movement to select S.
   Note: Reverse this action to return to D.
5. While in Sport (S), manual selection of the
   gears can be made by pulling the gear
   selector back for upshifts and pushing
   forward for downshifts.
   Manual gear selection status is displayed
   in the Message centre. See 35,
   INSTRUMENT PANEL.
   The relevant gear selector LED indicator will
   indicate the status of manual gear selection:
   •
   Continuous illumination confirms the
   driver's gear change request has been
   recognised and selected.
   •
   On/off flashing confirms the driver's
   gear change request has been
   recognised but not selected.
6. Gear shift paddles allow manual gear
   selection while in D or S. Operate the left
   paddle for downshifts and the right paddle
   for upshifts.
   Pull the paddle briefly to change gear.
   To exit manual mode, pull and hold the right
   paddle for approximately one second to
   return directly to previous automatic
   operation in D or S.
   Note: The gear shift paddles can be
   switched on and off, and configured to
   operate in 'S only' or 'D and S' via the
   Vehicle Set-up menu. See 35,
   INSTRUMENT PANEL.
   Do not allow the vehicle to remain
   stationary with a drive gear selected and
   the engine running. If the engine is to
   idle for a prolonged period, select N and
   apply the Parking brake.
   To allow the vehicle to roll freely, the
   transmission will need to be released from P
   with the operation of the Transmission park
   release, see 195, TRANSMISSION PARK
   RELEASE.
   Instructional video - Transmission controls.
   MANUAL GEAR SELECTION
   When D is selected, manual mode may be
   temporarily accessed by operating the steering
   wheel mounted shift paddles.
   While in D, temporary manual mode will be held
   while the driver is accelerating, decelerating,
   cornering, or continuing to request shifts via
   the paddles.

   Gearbox

If continued use of temporary manual mode (via
the shift paddles) is required, select S.
Temporary manual mode will be automatically
deactivated if the engine is over-revved or
laboured, to prevent transmission and/or engine
damage.
When the transmission is set to
permanent manual mode (i.e., using the
paddles to change gear while in the S
position and Dynamic mode is selected,
see 82, DYNAMIC MODE) transmission
upshifts are fully controlled by the driver.
This means that the transmission will
not change up a gear automatically, even
when the vehicle's rev limit is reached.
The gear position indicator in the
Message centre will glow amber, to
indicate that the next gear should be
selected. The gear shift warning lamp
will also illuminate. See 41, GEAR
SHIFT (GREEN).
LIMP-HOME MODE
Note: The driver should be aware that the
vehicle's performance will be reduced and must
take this into account when driving. The manual
gear shift, via the gear selector and steering
wheel paddles will be disabled. In this event,
seek qualified assistance as soon as possible.
See 40, ENGINE/TRANSMISSION (AMBER).
In the event of an electrical or mechanical
failure, transmission operation will be limited.
P, R, N, D and S may still be used to enable the
vehicle to be driven to a safe area.
Some faults will cause the gear selector to be
locked in position until the ignition is switched
off. If the selected range flashes, it signifies that
the driver request cannot be engaged. Re-select
N and repeat the attempt.
If the transmission is still unable to select the
requested gear, contact a Dealer/Authorised
Repairer.

DYNAMIC STABILITY CONTROL (DSC)
DSC is unable to compensate for driver
misjudgement. It remains the driver's
responsibility to drive with due care
and attention, in a manner which is
safe for the vehicle, its occupants, and
the other road users.
DSC optimises vehicle stability, even in critical
driving situations. The system controls dynamic
stability when accelerating and when starting
from a standstill. Additionally, it identifies
unstable driving behaviour, such as understeer
and oversteer, and helps to keep the vehicle
under control by manipulating the engine output
and applying the brakes at individual wheels.
Note: Some noise may be generated when the
brakes are applied.
When engaged, DSC will constantly
communicate with various vehicle management
systems to monitor the behaviour of the vehicle.
If necessary, it will engage and operate the
required system(s) to help maintain control of
the vehicle's dynamic stability.
These management systems include:
•
Engine.
•
Transmission.
•
Brakes.
•
Steering.
•
Suspension.
SWITCHING DSC OFF
Press and hold the DSC switch for more than
3 seconds.
•
The Message centre will display DSC Off
and a short warning chime will sound.
•
The DSC Off warning lamp in the Instrument
panel will illuminate. See 40, DYNAMIC
STABILITY CONTROL (DSC) (AMBER).
SWITCHING DSC ON
Press the DSC switch for 1 second and then
release.
The DSC system will switch on, the Message
centre will temporarily display DSC On.
Note: Switching the engine off and then on
again, will always revert DSC status to DSC On,
regardless of which mode is selected.
TRACDSC
Vehicle safety may be reduced by
inappropriate use of TracDSC. TracDSC
should only be used in suitable
conditions.
81
Stability control

TracDSC is an alternative setting of DSC, with
reduced system interventions. With TracDSC
engaged, traction may be increased, although
stability may be reduced compared to normal
DSC. TracDSC is intended for use only on dry
tarmac, by suitably experienced drivers.
TracDSC should not be selected for other
surfaces or by drivers with insufficient skill and
training to operate the vehicle safely with the
TracDSC function engaged.
Press and hold the DSC switch for 1 second
and then release.
SWITCHING BETWEEN DSC AND
TRACDSC
Press and hold the DSC switch for less than
seconds. The Message centre will temporarily
display either TracDSC or DSC On.
The DSC Off warning lamp will illuminate when
TracDSC is active.
Note: Cruise control will automatically be
disengaged.
JAGUARDRIVE CONTROL
The JaguarDrive control switch is located on
the driver's side of the centre console, next to
the gear selector. See 234, DRIVER CONTROLS.
Note: The switch lever will always return to the
centre position when released, regardless of the
mode selection.

1. Move the switch lever to the Rain/Ice/Snow
   mode position to engage. Repeat this action
   to disengage. See 82, RAIN/ICE/SNOW
   MODE.
2. Move the switch lever to the Dynamic mode
   position to engage. Repeat this action to
   disengage. See 82, DYNAMIC MODE.
   When Rain/Ice/Snow mode or Dynamic mode
   is engaged, the relevant switch lamp will remain
   illuminated.
   When Rain/Ice/Snow mode or Dynamic mode
   is disengaged, the relevant switch lamp will
   extinguish.
   RAIN/ICE/SNOW MODE
   Rain/Ice/Snow mode optimises
   stability of the vehicle to suit low
   grip conditions. This helps the
   vehicle to perform in a more gentle
   and controlled manner, to avoid
   skidding, allowing more confident
   progress under adverse conditions.
   Note: Rain/Ice/Snow mode cannot be active at
   the same time as Dynamic mode.
   Note: Rain/Ice/Snow mode will remain selected
   indefinitely, even after the ignition is switched
   off. Rain/Ice/Snow mode must be deselected,
   if no longer required.
   DYNAMIC MODE
   Dynamic mode coordinates the
   vehicle's control systems to deliver
   a high performance driving
   experience.
   Note: Dynamic mode cannot be active at the
   same time as Rain/Ice/Snow mode.

   Stability control

Note: Dynamic mode will remain selected for
approximately 6 hours after the ignition is
switched off, after which point it will need to be
selected again, if required.
Note: When the transmission is set to
permanent manual mode and Dynamic mode
is selected, transmission upshifts are fully
controlled by the driver. The transmission will
not change up automatically, even when the rev
limit is reached (the gear position indicator in
the Message centre will glow amber, to indicate
that the next gear should be selected).
Instructional video - Dynamic mode.

    SPOILER
    Make sure the Deployable Rear Spoiler
    (DRS) is fully retracted before using a
    car wash or a pressure washer.
    If a fault is detected in the DRS system, then
    the message SPOILER NOT AVAILABLE will be
    displayed in the Message centre. In some cases,
    the DRS system may reset by switching the
    ignition off for a few seconds and switching on
    again. If the message is still displayed, drive
    with caution and seek assistance from a
    Dealer/Authorised Repairer as soon as possible.
    Regularly check and clean the DRS housing and
    drainage areas.
    When driving in adverse conditions, make sure
    that the DRS is clear of obstructions (for
    example, ice, snow, leaves, etc.). Manually
    check the operation of the DRS before each
    journey.
    Do not attach or apply any loads to the DRS (for
    example, bicycle carrier, luggage rack, signs,
    etc.).
    Note: Continuous operation of the DRS may
    cause the system to overheat and cease
    operation. If this occurs allow sufficient time
    for the system to cool.
    Automatic mode (Convertible only)
    The DRS will automatically deploy when the
    vehicle reaches a speed of 96 km/h (60 mph).
    The DRS will automatically retract if the
    vehicle's speed is below 64 km/h (40 mph).
    Automatic mode (Coupe only)
    The DRS will automatically deploy when the
    vehicle reaches a speed of 113 km/h (70 mph).
    The DRS will retract if the vehicle's speed is
    below 80 km/h (50 mph).
    Manual mode
    Press the switch to manually deploy the DRS
    at speeds below 96 km/h (60 mph) on the

ACTIVE DIFFERENTIAL CONTROL
The Active differential control (E-diff) improves
traction on uneven road surfaces and can also
improve stability in oversteer situations.
If the warning message EDIFF SYSTEM FAULT
is displayed and DSC is off, then TracDSC will
be automatically selected. The vehicle can still
be driven and DSC modes can be selected, but
seek qualified assistance as soon as possible.
If the warning message EDIFF NOT AVAILABLE
is displayed, the system has temporarily shut
down to prevent overheating. The vehicle can
still be driven and the E-diff will be operational
again when the system has cooled sufficiently.
During the first 1 600 km (1 000 miles):
•
Avoid full throttle applications and do not
exceed 190 km/h (120 mph). Observe the
national speed limits in the country in which
you are travelling.
•
Avoid prolonged periods in excess of
km/h (100 mph).
During the first 8 000 km (5 000 miles):
•
Do not exceed 250 km/h (155 mph).
•
Do not participate in motor racing events,
track days, sports driving schools, or
similar.

DYNAMICS FAULT is displayed in the Message
centre, some reduction in ride comfort may be
experienced. If the fault persists, consult a
Dealer/Authorised Repairer.
87
Suspension

IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Do not rest your foot on the brake pedal
while the vehicle is in motion.
Never allow the vehicle to coast
(freewheel) with the engine turned off.
The engine must be running to provide
full braking assistance. The brakes will
still function with the engine off, but
far more pressure will be required to
operate them.
If the red brake warning lamp
illuminates, safely bring the vehicle to
a stop, as quickly as possible and seek
qualified assistance. See 38, BRAKE
(RED).
If the yellow brake warning lamp
illuminates, drive with care, avoiding
heavy brake application and seek
qualified assistance. See 39, BRAKE
(YELLOW).
Never place non-approved floor
matting or any other obstructions under
the pedals. This restricts pedal travel
and braking efficiency.
Additional brake pedal force may be
required in wet conditions.
On vehicles with carbon ceramic
brakes, it is recommended that the
brake fluid is replaced prior to using
the vehicle on closed roads. It is also
recommended that the brake fluid is
replaced after driving the vehicle on
closed roads.
Only use the recommended brake fluid.
See 201, LUBRICANTS AND FLUIDS.
Note: Operating noise levels of carbon ceramic
brake discs can be higher than those associated
with iron brake discs.
Note: Brake disc and pad wear will increase if
aggressive braking techniques are employed.
Note: On vehicles with carbon ceramic brakes,
the brake fluid requires replacing every 2 years
regardless of distance, and not every 3 years
as stated in your Service Portfolio.
Driving through heavy rain or water can have
an adverse effect on braking efficiency. Under
such circumstances, it is recommended that
you lightly apply the brakes intermittently, to
dry the brakes.
EMERGENCY BRAKE ASSIST (EBA)
If the driver rapidly applies the brakes, EBA
automatically boosts the braking force to its
maximum, in order to bring the vehicle to a halt
as quickly as possible.
EBA stops operating as soon as the brake pedal
is released.
A fault with the EBA system is indicated by the
brake warning lamp (see 38, BRAKE (RED))
illuminating and a warning message displayed
in the Message centre. Drive with care, avoiding
heavy brake application and seek qualified
assistance.
ELECTRONIC BRAKE FORCE
DISTRIBUTION (EBD)
EBD controls the balance of braking forces
supplied to the front and rear wheels, in order
to maintain maximum braking efficiency.
If the vehicle has a light load (only the driver in
the vehicle, for example), EBD will reduce the
braking force applied to the rear wheels. If the
vehicle is heavily laden, EBD will allow greater
braking force to the rear wheels.
A fault with the EBD system is indicated by the
brake warning lamp (see 38, BRAKE (RED))
illuminating and an associated warning
message. Gently and safely stop the vehicle and
seek qualified assistance.
88
Brakes

ELECTRIC PARKING BRAKE (EPB)
The Parking brakes operate on the rear
wheels; therefore, secure parking of the
vehicle is dependent on being on a hard
and stable surface.
Do not rely on the Parking brake to
operate effectively, if the rear wheels
have been immersed in mud or water.
With the ignition switched on, press the brake
pedal and press down on the EPB switch (1).
This will release the Parking brake.
With the vehicle stationary, press the brake
pedal and pull up the EPB switch (2). This will
apply the Parking brake. A warning lamp (see
39, PARKING BRAKE (RED)) illuminates to
indicate that the Parking brake is applied.
If the EPB switch is operated when the vehicle's
speed is less than 3 km/h (2 mph), the vehicle
will be brought to an abrupt stop. The stop
lamps will not be illuminated.
Driving the vehicle with the Parking
brake applied, or repeated use of the
Parking brake to slow the vehicle, may
cause serious damage to the brake
system.
In an emergency, with the vehicle travelling at
more than 3 km/h (2 mph), pulling on the EPB
switch and holding gives a gradual reduction in
the speed. The brake warning lamp will
illuminate accompanied by a warning tone and
a warning message in the Message centre. The
stop lamps will illuminate.
If the vehicle is stationary with the EPB applied
and the transmission in P, selecting D, N, or R
will release the EPB and allow the vehicle to
move off. See 78, AUTOMATIC
TRANSMISSION.
Note: Automatic release of the EPB is only
possible when the driver's door is closed or the
driver's seat belt is buckled.
If the system detects a fault with the EPB, the
amber brake warning lamp will illuminate
accompanied by a message in the Message
centre.
If the system detects a fault while the EPB is
operating, the red Parking brake warning lamp
will flash, accompanied by a message in the
Message centre.
Note: The red Parking brake warning lamp will
continue to be illuminated for at least
seconds after the ignition has been turned off.

USING THE PARKING AID
Parking aids may not detect moving
objects, such as children and animals,
until they are dangerously close.
Always use extreme caution when
manoeuvring.
Parking aid sensors may not detect
some obstructions (e.g., narrow posts
or small objects close to the ground).
If accessories are fitted to the rear of the
vehicle, particular care must be taken
when reversing. The rear sensors will
only indicate the distance from the
bumper to the obstacle.

1. Parking aid switch: Press to turn on or off.
2. Parking aid detection range.
   When Reverse (R) is selected, the front and rear
   parking sensors are activated automatically, and
   the indicator on the Parking aid switch will
   illuminate.
   When Drive (D) is selected, the front sensors
   must be activated by pressing the Parking aid
   switch; the switch indicator will illuminate.
   To turn off the system when active, press the
   switch; the switch indicator will extinguish.
   The range of the Parking aid sensors varies
   between the front, rear, and corners of the
   vehicle.
   When activated, the front sensors will remain
   active as long as the vehicle's forward speed
   does not exceed 16 km/h (10 mph).
   Selecting N from R will keep front and rear
   sensors active.
   When Parking aid is active, a pop-up appears
   on the Touch screen showing a plan view of the
   vehicle and the immediate surrounding area.
   Touch Display Off to cancel the view.

   Parking aids

Note: If a rear camera is fitted, when Reverse
(R) gear is selected, the camera display is
selected automatically. To view the Parking aid
display, touch the screen.
When objects are detected, the Parking aid
emits a warning tone which increases in
frequency as the vehicle gets closer to the object
and then becomes constant when the obstacle
is within 300 mm (12 ins).
Note: The front Parking aid provides an audible
proximity warning when driving forwards and
when reversing.
CLEANING THE SENSORS
When washing the vehicle, do not aim
high pressure water jets directly at the
sensors. Do not use abrasive materials
or hard/sharp objects to clean the
sensors. Only use approved vehicle
shampoo.
The sensors should be kept clean to maintain
accuracy and performance.
PARKING AID SYSTEM FAULT
If a system fault is detected, a long high-pitched
tone will sound, and the switch indicator will
flash. Contact your Dealer/Authorised Repairer
as soon as possible.
PARKING AID VOLUME
To set the volume of the Parking aid warning
tones:
•
Select Setup from the Touch screen Home
menu, then select System.
•

soft keys alongside Parking aid to adjust
the volume for both the front and rear
warning tones, or rotate the volume control
when the warning tones are sounding.
REAR CAMERA
It remains the driver's responsibility
to detect obstacles and estimate the
vehicle's distance from them when
reversing.
When Reverse gear (R) is selected, the Touch
screen automatically displays a wide-angle,
colour image from the rear of your vehicle.
The rear camera system provides a rear-view
image to assist in reversing the vehicle. Overlaid
on the image are reversing guidelines.
A. Solid line: The projected wheel trajectory.
B. Dotted line: The safe working width of the
vehicle (including exterior mirrors).
C. Luggage compartment access guidelines:

REVERSE TRAFFIC DETECTION
The Reverse Traffic Detection (RTD)
system is a supplement to, not a
replacement for, safe driving, good
observation, and use of the exterior
and rear-view mirrors.
In addition to the functionality provided by the
rear camera, the RTD system provides a
warning to the driver of any moving vehicle, at
either side, that may pose an accident risk
during a reversing manoeuvre.
An amber warning icon (1) will flash in the
relevant exterior mirror and an audible warning
will be emitted, to indicate the presence of a
moving vehicle. The rear camera screen (2) or
the Parking aid screen (3) will also show a
warning on the relevant side(s) of the screen.
To switch between the rear camera and the
Parking aid screen, touch the camera image or
the Rear Camera icon accordingly.
The system can be enabled or disabled via the
instrument panel menu, see 35, INSTRUMENT
PANEL MENU. When RTD is disabled, an amber
dot (4) will be displayed in both exterior mirrors.
93
Parking aids

REVERSE TRAFFIC DETECTION
SENSORS
The RTD system will automatically disable if
any of the sensors become partially or
completely obscured, and the amber warning
indicator dot will illuminate in the exterior
mirrors and the message Reverse Traffic
Sensor Blocked appears in the Message centre.
Check that there is nothing obscuring the rear
bumper and it is clear from ice, frost, snow,
mud, and dirt.
If a fault with a radar sensor is detected, an
amber warning indicator dot will illuminate in
the exterior mirrors and the message Reverse
Traffic Detection System Not Available is
displayed in the Message centre.
Note: Even if the detected fault only affects the
radar sensor on one side of the vehicle, the
whole system is disabled. If the fault is
temporary, the system will operate correctly
once the engine has been switched off and then
on again.
If a fault occurs, consult your Dealer/Authorised
Repairer.

ASL CONTROLS
In certain conditions, such as a steep
downhill gradient, the vehicle's speed
may exceed the set speed limit. This
is because engine braking is unable to
maintain or reduce the vehicle's speed.

1. ASL on/off: The ASL button switches
   between Cruise control and ASL. The
   systems cannot be used simultaneously.
   The ASL warning lamp will illuminate when
   ASL is active. See 40, AUTOMATIC SPEED
   LIMITER (AMBER).
   Note: ASL only operates at speeds between
   30 km/h (18 mph) and 240 km/h (150
   mph). However, the speed limit can be set
   while the vehicle is stationary.
2. Set/increase the speed limit: The set speed
   limit will be displayed in the Message
   centre.
   When a speed has been set, the engine will
   respond normally up to the set speed.
   Further accelerator pressure will not
   increase the speed beyond the set speed,
   unless sudden, rapid acceleration
   (kickdown) is applied. If kickdown is
   initiated, ASL will be suspended.
3. Resume ASL assistance: ASL will only
   resume if the vehicle's speed is less than
   the set speed and greater than 30 km/h (18
   mph). If these criteria are not met, a
   message will be displayed in the Message
   centre.
4. Decrease the speed limit: The set speed
   limit will be displayed in the Message
   centre.
5. Suspend ASL assistance: ASL can also be
   suspended by applying sudden, rapid
   acceleration (kickdown).

   Automatic speed limiter (ASL)

USING CRUISE CONTROL
In certain conditions, such as a steep
gradient, the vehicle's speed may
exceed the set cruising speed. This is
because engine braking is unable to
maintain or reduce the vehicle's speed.
Driver intervention may be required.
The system is operated by controls mounted
on the steering wheel. The driver can also
intervene, at any time, by use of the brake or
accelerator pedals.

1. SET+: Press to set the speed or to increase
   the set speed. The Cruise control warning
   lamp will illuminate to confirm that Cruise
   control is operational (see 41, CRUISE
   CONTROL (GREEN)).
   The cruising speed can also be increased
   using the accelerator. When the desired
   speed is reached, press the button to set
   and maintain the new speed, and then
   release the accelerator.
   Note: Cruise control can only be engaged
   at speeds in excess of 30 km/h (18 mph).
2. RES: Press to resume the set speed.
   RES should be used only if the driver is
   aware of the set speed and intends to
   return to it.
3. Press to decrease the set speed.
4. CAN: Press to cancel, but retain the set
   speed in the memory.
   Cruise control will also be cancelled if the
   brake pedal is pressed, the gear selector is
   moved to Neutral (N), or if DSC is activated.
   Note: If the accelerator pedal is pressed for
   more than 5 minutes, Cruise control will be
   cancelled.

# Blind spot monitoring

Note: The system covers an area of a fixed lane
width. If the lanes are narrower than a typical
carriageway lane, objects travelling in
non-adjacent lanes may be detected.
BSM automatically switches on and becomes
active when the vehicle is travelling at more than
10 km/h (6 mph) in a forward gear. When the
system initiates, it performs a self-check, during
which the warning icons in the mirrors
illuminate alternately for a short period of time.
The indicator dot (2) remains illuminated until
forward vehicle speed exceeds 10 km/h (6
mph).
Note: BSM is automatically turned off when
Reverse (R) gear is selected, when the vehicle
is in Park (P), or the vehicle is travelling below
5 km/h (3 mph). Under these conditions, an
amber warning indicator within the exterior
mirror is displayed.
BSM is designed to work most effectively when
driving on multi-lane highways.
BSM can be enabled or disabled through the
Instrument panel menu. See 35, INSTRUMENT
PANEL MENU.
Note: If an overtaking vehicle is detected on
both sides of the vehicle simultaneously, the
warning icons in both mirrors will illuminate.
Instructional video - Blind spot monitoring.
CLOSING VEHICLE SENSING
Closing vehicle sensing is a
supplement to, not a replacement for,
a safe driving style and use of the
exterior and rear-view mirrors.
Closing vehicle sensing may not be
able to give adequate warning of
vehicles approaching very quickly from
directly behind the vehicle. Always use
the exterior and rear-view mirrors.
The radar sensors may be impaired by
mud, rain, frost, ice, snow, or road
spray. This may affect the system's
ability to reliably detect an
approaching vehicle.
Make sure that the warning indicators
in the exterior mirrors are not obscured
by stickers or other objects.
Do not attach stickers or objects to the
rear bumpers, that may interfere with
the radar sensors.
53
Blind spot monitoring

Closing vehicle sensing is designed to perform
best on multi-lane motorways with free-flowing
traffic and is operational above 13 km/h (8 mph)
in a forward gear.

1. Closing vehicle sensing monitors an area
   behind the vehicle, up to a distance of
   metres (197 ft) and approximately 2.5
   metres (8 ft) from each side of the vehicle
   (the width of a typical carriageway lane).
2. If a vehicle is detected approaching rapidly,
   an amber warning icon will flash in the
   relevant exterior mirror to indicate that there
   is a potential danger.
3. When the detected vehicle reaches the area
   monitored by the BSM, the amber warning
   icon will illuminate continuously.
   Note: If rapidly overtaking vehicles are detected
   on both sides simultaneously, the warning icons
   in both mirrors will flash.
   Note: The system covers an area of a fixed lane
   width. If the lanes are narrower than a typical
   carriageway lane, objects travelling in
   non-adjacent lanes may be detected.
   Note: Closing vehicle sensing is disabled when
   the vehicle is negotiating a tight radius curve.
   Note: When BSM is disabled, Closing vehicle
   sensing is also disabled. See 52, BLIND SPOT
   MONITOR.
   Note: This radar sensor is approved in all RTTE
   countries.
   BSM SENSORS
   The BSM system will automatically disable if
   either of the sensors become completely
   obscured, an amber warning indicator dot (2)
   is displayed in the exterior mirror and the
   message BLIND SPOT MONITOR SENSOR
   BLOCKED appears in the Message centre.
   Note: Blockage testing is only initiated when
   the vehicle's speed is above 10 km/h (6 mph)
   and will take at least 2 minutes of accumulated
   driving above this speed, to determine that the
   sensor is blocked.
   If the sensors become blocked, then please
   check that there is nothing obscuring the rear
   bumper and that it is clear from ice, frost, and
   dirt.
   If a fault with one of the radar sensors is
   detected, an amber warning indicator dot is
   displayed in the exterior mirror and the message
   BLIND SPOT MONITOR NOT AVAILABLE is
   displayed in the Message centre.
   Note: Even if the detected fault only affects the
   radar sensor on one side of the vehicle, the
   whole system is disabled. If the fault is
   temporary, the system will operate correctly
   once the engine has been switched off and then
   on again.
   If a fault in the system occurs, consult your
   Dealer/Authorised Repairer.

GARAGE DOOR TRANSCEIVER
Do not use the transceiver with any
garage door opener that lacks the
safety stop and reverse feature, as
required by safety standards.
When programming the transceiver to
a garage door opener or entry gate,
make sure the area is clear. This will
prevent potential harm or damage as
the gate or garage door will activate
during the programme.
This device may suffer from interference
if operated in the vicinity of a mobile or
fixed station transmitter. This
interference is likely to affect the
hand-held transmitter as well as the
in-car transceiver.
The door transceiver is located in the rear-view
mirror. It can be programmed to transmit the
Radio Frequencies (RFs) of up to 3 different
transmitters, which can be used to operate
garage doors, entry gates, home lighting,
security systems, or other RF operated devices.
Although this section mainly describes the
procedures for a garage door opener, it equally
applies to the previously mentioned
applications.
In some countries, this feature is also known
as the HomeLink® Universal Transceiver.
For further information, see 57, INFORMATION
AND ASSISTANCE.
BEFORE PROGRAMMING
When programming a device that may
require you to press and re-press the
hand-held transmitter (cycle), unplug
the device during the cycling process to
prevent possible motor failure.
For best results, fit a new battery to the
hand-held transmitter of the garage door opener
(or other device) before programming. If your
garage door opener receiver (located in the
garage) is equipped with an antenna, make sure
that the antenna is hanging straight down.
PROGRAMMING
Making sure that the engine is switched off:

1. Make sure that the ignition system is on.
2. Hold the end of the original garage door
   opener hand-held transmitter 50 to 150 mm
   (2 to 6 inches) away from the transceiver
   in the rear-view mirror; keeping the
   indicator lamp in view.
3. Using both hands, simultaneously press
   and hold both the chosen transceiver button
   on the rear-view mirror, as shown above,
   and the hand-held transmitter button. Keep
   both buttons pressed. The indicator lamp
   will flash slowly at first and then change to
   a fast flash. When the indicator lamp flashes
   rapidly, release both buttons. The rapid
   flashing lamp indicates successful
   programming.
4. If, after 60 seconds, the indicator lamp does
   not flash rapidly, release both the
   transceiver and the hand-held transmitter
   buttons and repeat the procedure starting
   with step 2. Position the hand-held
   transmitter at a different angle and/or
   distance.

   Garage door opener

5. Press and hold the programmed garage
   door opener button and observe the
   indicator lamp.
   •
   If the indicator is continuous,
   programming is complete and your
   device should operate when the garage
   door opener button is pressed and held
   for approximately 1 to 2 seconds and
   then released.
   •
   If the indicator lamp blinks rapidly for
   2 seconds and then illuminates
   continuously, proceed with the
   following programming instructions for
   rolling code device equipment.
   Instructional video - Garage door opener.
   TO ERASE ALL PROGRAMMING
   For first time programming, make sure that the
   engine is switched off:
6. Make sure the ignition system is switched
   on.
7. Press and hold the two outer buttons on
   the transceiver in the rear-view mirror. Keep
   the buttons pressed until the indicator lamp
   begins to flash (this will take approximately
   20 seconds), then release the buttons.
   All memories in the garage door opener have
   now been cleared.
   Note: Do not perform this procedure when
   programming the additional garage door opener
   buttons.
   ROLLING CODE DEVICE EQUIPMENT
   PROGRAMMING
   Note: The assistance of a second person, may
   make the following steps quicker and easier.
   Once the button has been pressed, there are
   only 30 seconds in which to complete step 3.
8. At the garage door opener receiver (motor
   head unit) in the garage, locate the learn or
   smart button/switch. The name of the
   button or switch may vary between
   manufacturers.
9. Press and release the learn or smart button.

ELECTRIC WINDOWS
To prevent accidental operation, never
leave the Smart key in the vehicle if
children or animals are also left in the
vehicle.
Window switches: The windows will operate for
5 minutes after the engine is switched off, as
long as none of the doors are opened.
When the door is closed: press (or pull) the
switch briefly to open (or close) a window.
Window travel can be stopped at any time by
operating the switch again.
Both windows have a one-touch facility.
Any ice should be removed from the
windows prior to operation.
Vehicles with a glass panoramic roof are
supplied with a roof blind. This is manually
operated to any position, via the recessed
handle at the front of the roof blind.
Any other method of operation may
cause misalignment or damage to the
roof blind.
WINDOW ANTI-TRAP PROTECTION
Before closing a window, make sure
that no occupants have any part of their
body in a position where it could be
trapped. Death or serious injury could
occur, even with an Anti-trap system.
Anti-trap protection is designed to stop window
movement if an obstruction or resistance is
detected. Check the window and its aperture
and remove any obstructions. The override
procedure is as follows:

1. Attempt to close the window. Anti-trap will
   prevent closure and lower the window.
2. Within 10 seconds, attempt to raise the
   window again. Anti-trap will prevent closure
   and lower the window.
3. Attempt to close the window for a third
   time, this time holding the switch in the
   close position. The window will raise whilst
   the switch is held. Hold until closed.
   Note: If this procedure fails to remove the
   blockage, or if the windows do not operate
   correctly, the window operation may need to be
   reset. See 148, WINDOW RESET.

appropriate LED indicator lamp, on top of the
gear selector, will illuminate to confirm
selection.
Note: When the gear selector is released, after
normal operation, it will return to the central
position, except for when in the Sport (S)
position.
Park (P) should only be engaged when
the vehicle is stationary. If any other
gear position is selected while the
vehicle is stationary, the vehicle can
move unexpectedly, which may result
in death or serious injury. Always make
sure the Parking brake is applied after
engaging P.
Never select P while the vehicle is in
motion. Doing so can result in serious
transmission damage.
Note: P cannot be selected by manually moving
the gear selector.

1. Press to select Park (P). The P LED
   indicator lamp will illuminate to confirm.
   Select P before switching off the engine.
   Note: P can be selected from any gear
   selector position.
   Note: If the engine is switched off with
   Neutral (N) selected, the system will wait
   for 10 minutes before selecting P. This
   procedure is to allow the vehicle to be
   conveyed through a car wash only and
   should not be used for vehicle recovery
   purposes. See 195, TRANSPORTING THE
   VEHICLE.

   A rearward movement to select D.
   •
   A short forward movement to select N.
   •
   A longer forward movement to select
   R.
   Never select R while the vehicle is in
   forward motion. Doing so can result in
   serious transmission damage.
   Never select a forward gear while the
   vehicle is moving backwards. Doing so
   can result in serious transmission
   damage.
   Note: The release button is required for all
   gear selections, except for when selecting
   N from D or R and selecting S from D or D
   from S.
4. While in D, move the gear selector one side
   movement to select S.
   Note: Reverse this action to return to D.
5. While in Sport (S), manual selection of the
   gears can be made by pulling the gear
   selector back for upshifts and pushing
   forward for downshifts.
   Manual gear selection status is displayed
   in the Message centre. See 35,
   INSTRUMENT PANEL.
   The relevant gear selector LED indicator will
   indicate the status of manual gear selection:
   •
   Continuous illumination confirms the
   driver's gear change request has been
   recognised and selected.
   •
   On/off flashing confirms the driver's
   gear change request has been
   recognised but not selected.
6. Gear shift paddles allow manual gear
   selection while in D or S. Operate the left
   paddle for downshifts and the right paddle
   for upshifts.
   Pull the paddle briefly to change gear.
   To exit manual mode, pull and hold the right
   paddle for approximately one second to
   return directly to previous automatic
   operation in D or S.
   Note: The gear shift paddles can be
   switched on and off, and configured to
   operate in 'S only' or 'D and S' via the
   Vehicle Set-up menu. See 35,
   INSTRUMENT PANEL.
   Do not allow the vehicle to remain
   stationary with a drive gear selected and
   the engine running. If the engine is to
   idle for a prolonged period, select N and
   apply the Parking brake.
   To allow the vehicle to roll freely, the
   transmission will need to be released from P
   with the operation of the Transmission park
   release, see 195, TRANSMISSION PARK
   RELEASE.
   Instructional video - Transmission controls.
   MANUAL GEAR SELECTION
   When D is selected, manual mode may be
   temporarily accessed by operating the steering
   wheel mounted shift paddles.
   While in D, temporary manual mode will be held
   while the driver is accelerating, decelerating,
   cornering, or continuing to request shifts via
   the paddles.

   Gearbox

If continued use of temporary manual mode (via
the shift paddles) is required, select S.
Temporary manual mode will be automatically
deactivated if the engine is over-revved or
laboured, to prevent transmission and/or engine
damage.
When the transmission is set to
permanent manual mode (i.e., using the
paddles to change gear while in the S
position and Dynamic mode is selected,
see 82, DYNAMIC MODE) transmission
upshifts are fully controlled by the driver.
This means that the transmission will
not change up a gear automatically, even
when the vehicle's rev limit is reached.
The gear position indicator in the
Message centre will glow amber, to
indicate that the next gear should be
selected. The gear shift warning lamp
will also illuminate. See 41, GEAR
SHIFT (GREEN).
LIMP-HOME MODE
Note: The driver should be aware that the
vehicle’s performance will be reduced and must
take this into account when driving. The manual
gear shift, via the gear selector and steering
wheel paddles will be disabled. In this event,
seek qualified assistance as soon as possible.
See 40, ENGINE/TRANSMISSION (AMBER).
In the event of an electrical or mechanical
failure, transmission operation will be limited.
P, R, N, D and S may still be used to enable the
vehicle to be driven to a safe area.
Some faults will cause the gear selector to be
locked in position until the ignition is switched
off. If the selected range flashes, it signifies that
the driver request cannot be engaged. Re-select
N and repeat the attempt.
If the transmission is still unable to select the
requested gear, contact a Dealer/Authorised
Repairer.

DYNAMIC STABILITY CONTROL (DSC)
DSC is unable to compensate for driver
misjudgement. It remains the driver's
responsibility to drive with due care
and attention, in a manner which is
safe for the vehicle, its occupants, and
the other road users.
DSC optimises vehicle stability, even in critical
driving situations. The system controls dynamic
stability when accelerating and when starting
from a standstill. Additionally, it identifies
unstable driving behaviour, such as understeer
and oversteer, and helps to keep the vehicle
under control by manipulating the engine output
and applying the brakes at individual wheels.
Note: Some noise may be generated when the
brakes are applied.
When engaged, DSC will constantly
communicate with various vehicle management
systems to monitor the behaviour of the vehicle.
If necessary, it will engage and operate the
required system(s) to help maintain control of
the vehicle's dynamic stability.
These management systems include:
•
Engine.
•
Transmission.
•
Brakes.
•
Steering.
•
Suspension.
SWITCHING DSC OFF
Press and hold the DSC switch for more than
3 seconds.
•
The Message centre will display DSC Off
and a short warning chime will sound.
•
The DSC Off warning lamp in the Instrument
panel will illuminate. See 40, DYNAMIC
STABILITY CONTROL (DSC) (AMBER).
SWITCHING DSC ON
Press the DSC switch for 1 second and then
release.
The DSC system will switch on, the Message
centre will temporarily display DSC On.
Note: Switching the engine off and then on
again, will always revert DSC status to DSC On,
regardless of which mode is selected.
TRACDSC
Vehicle safety may be reduced by
inappropriate use of TracDSC. TracDSC
should only be used in suitable
conditions.
81
Stability control

TracDSC is an alternative setting of DSC, with
reduced system interventions. With TracDSC
engaged, traction may be increased, although
stability may be reduced compared to normal
DSC. TracDSC is intended for use only on dry
tarmac, by suitably experienced drivers.
TracDSC should not be selected for other
surfaces or by drivers with insufficient skill and
training to operate the vehicle safely with the
TracDSC function engaged.
Press and hold the DSC switch for 1 second
and then release.
SWITCHING BETWEEN DSC AND
TRACDSC
Press and hold the DSC switch for less than
seconds. The Message centre will temporarily
display either TracDSC or DSC On.
The DSC Off warning lamp will illuminate when
TracDSC is active.
Note: Cruise control will automatically be
disengaged.
JAGUARDRIVE CONTROL
The JaguarDrive control switch is located on
the driver's side of the centre console, next to
the gear selector. See 234, DRIVER CONTROLS.
Note: The switch lever will always return to the
centre position when released, regardless of the
mode selection.

1. Move the switch lever to the Rain/Ice/Snow
   mode position to engage. Repeat this action
   to disengage. See 82, RAIN/ICE/SNOW
   MODE.
2. Move the switch lever to the Dynamic mode
   position to engage. Repeat this action to
   disengage. See 82, DYNAMIC MODE.
   When Rain/Ice/Snow mode or Dynamic mode
   is engaged, the relevant switch lamp will remain
   illuminated.
   When Rain/Ice/Snow mode or Dynamic mode
   is disengaged, the relevant switch lamp will
   extinguish.
   RAIN/ICE/SNOW MODE
   Rain/Ice/Snow mode optimises
   stability of the vehicle to suit low
   grip conditions. This helps the
   vehicle to perform in a more gentle
   and controlled manner, to avoid
   skidding, allowing more confident
   progress under adverse conditions.
   Note: Rain/Ice/Snow mode cannot be active at
   the same time as Dynamic mode.
   Note: Rain/Ice/Snow mode will remain selected
   indefinitely, even after the ignition is switched
   off. Rain/Ice/Snow mode must be deselected,
   if no longer required.
   DYNAMIC MODE
   Dynamic mode coordinates the
   vehicle's control systems to deliver
   a high performance driving
   experience.
   Note: Dynamic mode cannot be active at the
   same time as Rain/Ice/Snow mode.

   Stability control

Note: Dynamic mode will remain selected for
approximately 6 hours after the ignition is
switched off, after which point it will need to be
selected again, if required.
Note: When the transmission is set to
permanent manual mode and Dynamic mode
is selected, transmission upshifts are fully
controlled by the driver. The transmission will
not change up automatically, even when the rev
limit is reached (the gear position indicator in
the Message centre will glow amber, to indicate
that the next gear should be selected).

    SPOILER
    Make sure the Deployable Rear Spoiler
    (DRS) is fully retracted before using a
    car wash or a pressure washer.
    If a fault is detected in the DRS system, then
    the message SPOILER NOT AVAILABLE will be
    displayed in the Message centre. In some cases,
    the DRS system may reset by switching the
    ignition off for a few seconds and switching on
    again. If the message is still displayed, drive
    with caution and seek assistance from a
    Dealer/Authorised Repairer as soon as possible.
    Regularly check and clean the DRS housing and
    drainage areas.
    When driving in adverse conditions, make sure
    that the DRS is clear of obstructions (for
    example, ice, snow, leaves, etc.). Manually
    check the operation of the DRS before each
    journey.
    Do not attach or apply any loads to the DRS (for
    example, bicycle carrier, luggage rack, signs,
    etc.).
    Note: Continuous operation of the DRS may
    cause the system to overheat and cease
    operation. If this occurs allow sufficient time
    for the system to cool.
    Automatic mode (Convertible only)
    The DRS will automatically deploy when the
    vehicle reaches a speed of 96 km/h (60 mph).
    The DRS will automatically retract if the
    vehicle's speed is below 64 km/h (40 mph).
    Automatic mode (Coupe only)
    The DRS will automatically deploy when the
    vehicle reaches a speed of 113 km/h (70 mph).
    The DRS will retract if the vehicle's speed is
    below 80 km/h (50 mph).
    Manual mode

ACTIVE DIFFERENTIAL CONTROL
The Active differential control (E-diff) improves
traction on uneven road surfaces and can also
improve stability in oversteer situations.
If the warning message EDIFF SYSTEM FAULT
is displayed and DSC is off, then TracDSC will
be automatically selected. The vehicle can still
be driven and DSC modes can be selected, but
seek qualified assistance as soon as possible.
If the warning message EDIFF NOT AVAILABLE
is displayed, the system has temporarily shut
down to prevent overheating. The vehicle can
still be driven and the E-diff will be operational
again when the system has cooled sufficiently.
During the first 1 600 km (1 000 miles):
•
Avoid full throttle applications and do not
exceed 190 km/h (120 mph). Observe the
national speed limits in the country in which
you are travelling.
•
Avoid prolonged periods in excess of
km/h (100 mph).

Dealer/Authorised Repairer.
87
Suspension

IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Do not rest your foot on the brake pedal
while the vehicle is in motion.
Never allow the vehicle to coast
(freewheel) with the engine turned off.
The engine must be running to provide
full braking assistance. The brakes will
still function with the engine off, but
far more pressure will be required to
operate them.
If the red brake warning lamp
illuminates, safely bring the vehicle to
a stop, as quickly as possible and seek
qualified assistance. See 38, BRAKE
(RED).
If the yellow brake warning lamp
illuminates, drive with care, avoiding
heavy brake application and seek
qualified assistance. See 39, BRAKE
(YELLOW).
Never place non-approved floor
matting or any other obstructions under
the pedals. This restricts pedal travel
and braking efficiency.
Additional brake pedal force may be
required in wet conditions.
On vehicles with carbon ceramic
brakes, it is recommended that the
brake fluid is replaced prior to using
the vehicle on closed roads. It is also
recommended that the brake fluid is
replaced after driving the vehicle on
closed roads.
Only use the recommended brake fluid.
See 201, LUBRICANTS AND FLUIDS.
Note: Operating noise levels of carbon ceramic
brake discs can be higher than those associated
with iron brake discs.
Note: Brake disc and pad wear will increase if
aggressive braking techniques are employed.
Note: On vehicles with carbon ceramic brakes,
the brake fluid requires replacing every 2 years
regardless of distance, and not every 3 years
as stated in your Service Portfolio.
Driving through heavy rain or water can have
an adverse effect on braking efficiency. Under
such circumstances, it is recommended that
you lightly apply the brakes intermittently, to
dry the brakes.
EMERGENCY BRAKE ASSIST (EBA)
If the driver rapidly applies the brakes, EBA
automatically boosts the braking force to its
maximum, in order to bring the vehicle to a halt
as quickly as possible.
EBA stops operating as soon as the brake pedal
is released.
A fault with the EBA system is indicated by the
brake warning lamp (see 38, BRAKE (RED))
illuminating and a warning message displayed
in the Message centre. Drive with care, avoiding
heavy brake application and seek qualified
assistance.
ELECTRONIC BRAKE FORCE
DISTRIBUTION (EBD)
EBD controls the balance of braking forces
supplied to the front and rear wheels, in order
to maintain maximum braking efficiency.
If the vehicle has a light load (only the driver in
the vehicle, for example), EBD will reduce the
braking force applied to the rear wheels. If the
vehicle is heavily laden, EBD will allow greater
braking force to the rear wheels.
A fault with the EBD system is indicated by the
brake warning lamp (see 38, BRAKE (RED))
illuminating and an associated warning
message. Gently and safely stop the vehicle and
seek qualified assistance.
88
Brakes

ELECTRIC PARKING BRAKE (EPB)
The Parking brakes operate on the rear
wheels; therefore, secure parking of the
vehicle is dependent on being on a hard
and stable surface.
Do not rely on the Parking brake to
operate effectively, if the rear wheels
have been immersed in mud or water.
With the ignition switched on, press the brake
pedal and press down on the EPB switch (1).
This will release the Parking brake.
With the vehicle stationary, press the brake
pedal and pull up the EPB switch (2). This will
apply the Parking brake. A warning lamp (see
39, PARKING BRAKE (RED)) illuminates to
indicate that the Parking brake is applied.
If the EPB switch is operated when the vehicle's
speed is less than 3 km/h (2 mph), the vehicle
will be brought to an abrupt stop. The stop
lamps will not be illuminated.
Driving the vehicle with the Parking
brake applied, or repeated use of the
Parking brake to slow the vehicle, may
cause serious damage to the brake
system.
In an emergency, with the vehicle travelling at
more than 3 km/h (2 mph), pulling on the EPB
switch and holding gives a gradual reduction in
the speed. The brake warning lamp will
illuminate accompanied by a warning tone and
a warning message in the Message centre. The
stop lamps will illuminate.
If the vehicle is stationary with the EPB applied
and the transmission in P, selecting D, N, or R
will release the EPB and allow the vehicle to
move off. See 78, AUTOMATIC
TRANSMISSION.
Note: Automatic release of the EPB is only
possible when the driver’s door is closed or the
driver’s seat belt is buckled.
If the system detects a fault with the EPB, the
amber brake warning lamp will illuminate
accompanied by a message in the Message
centre.
If the system detects a fault while the EPB is
operating, the red Parking brake warning lamp
will flash, accompanied by a message in the
Message centre.
Note: The red Parking brake warning lamp will
continue to be illuminated for at least
seconds after the ignition has been turned off.

USING THE PARKING AID
Parking aids may not detect moving
objects, such as children and animals,
until they are dangerously close.
Always use extreme caution when
manoeuvring.
Parking aid sensors may not detect
some obstructions (e.g., narrow posts
or small objects close to the ground).
If accessories are fitted to the rear of the
vehicle, particular care must be taken
when reversing. The rear sensors will
only indicate the distance from the
bumper to the obstacle.

1. Parking aid switch: Press to turn on or off.
2. Parking aid detection range.
   When Reverse (R) is selected, the front and rear
   parking sensors are activated automatically, and
   the indicator on the Parking aid switch will
   illuminate.
   When Drive (D) is selected, the front sensors
   must be activated by pressing the Parking aid
   switch; the switch indicator will illuminate.
   To turn off the system when active, press the
   switch; the switch indicator will extinguish.
   The range of the Parking aid sensors varies
   between the front, rear, and corners of the
   vehicle.
   When activated, the front sensors will remain
   active as long as the vehicle's forward speed
   does not exceed 16 km/h (10 mph).
   Selecting N from R will keep front and rear
   sensors active.
   When Parking aid is active, a pop-up appears
   on the Touch screen showing a plan view of the
   vehicle and the immediate surrounding area.
   Touch Display Off to cancel the view.

   Parking aids

Note: If a rear camera is fitted, when Reverse
(R) gear is selected, the camera display is
selected automatically. To view the Parking aid
display, touch the screen.
When objects are detected, the Parking aid
emits a warning tone which increases in
frequency as the vehicle gets closer to the object
and then becomes constant when the obstacle
is within 300 mm (12 ins).
Note: The front Parking aid provides an audible
proximity warning when driving forwards and
when reversing.
CLEANING THE SENSORS
When washing the vehicle, do not aim
high pressure water jets directly at the
sensors. Do not use abrasive materials
or hard/sharp objects to clean the
sensors. Only use approved vehicle
shampoo.
The sensors should be kept clean to maintain
accuracy and performance.
PARKING AID SYSTEM FAULT
If a system fault is detected, a long high-pitched
tone will sound, and the switch indicator will
flash. Contact your Dealer/Authorised Repairer
as soon as possible.
PARKING AID VOLUME
To set the volume of the Parking aid warning
tones:
•
Select Setup from the Touch screen Home
menu, then select System.
•
Select Volume presets, then use the + or -
soft keys alongside Parking aid to adjust
the volume for both the front and rear
warning tones, or rotate the volume control
when the warning tones are sounding.
REAR CAMERA
It remains the driver's responsibility
to detect obstacles and estimate the
vehicle's distance from them when
reversing.
When Reverse gear (R) is selected, the Touch
screen automatically displays a wide-angle,
colour image from the rear of your vehicle.
The rear camera system provides a rear-view
image to assist in reversing the vehicle. Overlaid
on the image are reversing guidelines.
A. Solid line: The projected wheel trajectory.
B. Dotted line: The safe working width of the
vehicle (including exterior mirrors).

REVERSE TRAFFIC DETECTION
The Reverse Traffic Detection (RTD)
system is a supplement to, not a
replacement for, safe driving, good
observation, and use of the exterior
and rear-view mirrors.
In addition to the functionality provided by the
rear camera, the RTD system provides a
warning to the driver of any moving vehicle, at
either side, that may pose an accident risk
during a reversing manoeuvre.
An amber warning icon (1) will flash in the
relevant exterior mirror and an audible warning
will be emitted, to indicate the presence of a
moving vehicle. The rear camera screen (2) or
the Parking aid screen (3) will also show a
warning on the relevant side(s) of the screen.
To switch between the rear camera and the
Parking aid screen, touch the camera image or
the Rear Camera icon accordingly.
The system can be enabled or disabled via the
instrument panel menu, see 35, INSTRUMENT
PANEL MENU. When RTD is disabled, an amber
dot (4) will be displayed in both exterior mirrors.
93
Parking aids

REVERSE TRAFFIC DETECTION
SENSORS
The RTD system will automatically disable if
any of the sensors become partially or
completely obscured, and the amber warning
indicator dot will illuminate in the exterior
mirrors and the message Reverse Traffic
Sensor Blocked appears in the Message centre.
Check that there is nothing obscuring the rear
bumper and it is clear from ice, frost, snow,
mud, and dirt.
If a fault with a radar sensor is detected, an
amber warning indicator dot will illuminate in
the exterior mirrors and the message Reverse
Traffic Detection System Not Available is
displayed in the Message centre.
Note: Even if the detected fault only affects the
radar sensor on one side of the vehicle, the
whole system is disabled. If the fault is
temporary, the system will operate correctly

ASL CONTROLS
In certain conditions, such as a steep
downhill gradient, the vehicle's speed
may exceed the set speed limit. This
is because engine braking is unable to
maintain or reduce the vehicle's speed.

1. ASL on/off: The ASL button switches
   between Cruise control and ASL. The
   systems cannot be used simultaneously.
   The ASL warning lamp will illuminate when
   ASL is active. See 40, AUTOMATIC SPEED
   LIMITER (AMBER).
   Note: ASL only operates at speeds between
   30 km/h (18 mph) and 240 km/h (150
   mph). However, the speed limit can be set
   while the vehicle is stationary.
2. Set/increase the speed limit: The set speed
   limit will be displayed in the Message
   centre.
   When a speed has been set, the engine will
   respond normally up to the set speed.
   Further accelerator pressure will not
   increase the speed beyond the set speed,
   unless sudden, rapid acceleration
   (kickdown) is applied. If kickdown is
   initiated, ASL will be suspended.
3. Resume ASL assistance: ASL will only
   resume if the vehicle's speed is less than
   the set speed and greater than 30 km/h (18
   mph). If these criteria are not met, a
   message will be displayed in the Message
   centre.
4. Decrease the speed limit: The set speed
   limit will be displayed in the Message
   centre.
5. Suspend ASL assistance: ASL can also be
   suspended by applying sudden, rapid
   acceleration (kickdown).

   Automatic speed limiter (ASL)

USING CRUISE CONTROL
In certain conditions, such as a steep
gradient, the vehicle's speed may
exceed the set cruising speed. This is
because engine braking is unable to
maintain or reduce the vehicle's speed.
Driver intervention may be required.
The system is operated by controls mounted
on the steering wheel. The driver can also
intervene, at any time, by use of the brake or
accelerator pedals.

1. SET+: Press to set the speed or to increase
   the set speed. The Cruise control warning
   lamp will illuminate to confirm that Cruise
   control is operational (see 41, CRUISE
   CONTROL (GREEN)).
   The cruising speed can also be increased
   using the accelerator. When the desired
   speed is reached, press the button to set
   and maintain the new speed, and then
   release the accelerator.
   Note: Cruise control can only be engaged
   at speeds in excess of 30 km/h (18 mph).
2. RES: Press to resume the set speed.
   RES should be used only if the driver is
   aware of the set speed and intends to
   return to it.
3. Press to decrease the set speed.
4. CAN: Press to cancel, but retain the set
   speed in the memory.
   Cruise control will also be cancelled if the
   brake pedal is pressed, the gear selector is
   moved to Neutral (N), or if DSC is activated.
   Note: If the accelerator pedal is pressed for
   more than 5 minutes, Cruise control will be
   cancelled.

BLUETOOTH® INFORMATION
Bluetooth® is the name for
short-range Radio Frequency (RF)
technology that allows electronic
devices to communicate wirelessly
with each other.
The Jaguar Bluetooth wireless technology
system supports Bluetooth Hands-Free Profile
(HFP), Advanced Audio Distribution Profile
(A2DP), and Audio Video Remote Control Profile
(AVRCP).
Note: HFP and A2DP/AVRCP profiles can be
connected independently, so a phone can be
connected via one, while a media device can be
connected via the other, at the same time.
Before making use of the vehicle’s Bluetooth
wireless technology phone system, your
Bluetooth wireless technology device must be
paired and connected to the vehicle's system.
See 118, TELEPHONE COMPATIBILITY.
Each time the ignition is switched on, the
system will attempt to connect with the last
connected phone.
As mobile phones have a wide range of audio
and echo characteristics, it may take a few
seconds for the vehicle's system to adapt and
deliver optimum audio performance. To achieve
this, it may be necessary to reduce the
in-vehicle volume and ventilation fan speed
slightly.
TELEPHONE SAFETY
Switch off your telephone in areas with
a high explosion risk. This includes
filling stations, fuel storage areas, or
chemical factories, as well as places
where the air contains fuel vapour,
chemicals, or metal dust.
Always stow your mobile phone
securely.
The functioning of cardiac pacemakers
or hearing aids may be impaired when
the phone is in use. Check with a
doctor or manufacturer whether any
such devices you or your passengers
are using, are sufficiently protected
against high-frequency energy.
The Health Industry Manufacturers' Association
recommends that a minimum separation of
centimetres (6 inches) is maintained between
a wireless phone antenna and a pacemaker, to
avoid potential interference with the pacemaker.
These recommendations are consistent with the
independent research by, and recommendations
of, Wireless Technology Research.
TELEPHONE COMPATIBILITY
For a list of compatible phones and pairing
methods, on the Jaguar website
(<www.jaguar.com>), type 'Bluetooth' into the
search area.
Note: The Bluetooth® equipped phones listed,
have been tested for compatibility with Jaguar
vehicles. Performance will vary, based on the
phone’s software version, battery condition,
coverage, and your network provider. Phones
are warranted by their manufacturer, not Jaguar.
If the mobile phone supports Bluetooth
Hands-Free Profile 1.5 (HFP 1.5), additional
features will be displayed on the vehicle's Touch
screen, such as battery meter, signal strength,
and network operator.

THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
Navigation instruction is by map and turn
information displayed on the Touch screen and
can be complemented by voice guidance, if
required. The system uses signals from Global
Positioning System (GPS) satellites, combined
with information from vehicle sensors and from
data stored on the hard drive, to establish the
true vehicle's position.
Note: Mapping data loaded on the hard drive is
relevant to the market in which the vehicle is
first sold and will provide guidance and
information only for that area. Your Jaguar
Dealer/Authorised Repairer will have details of
software updates. Map updates can also be
acquired from the Ownership section of the
jaguar website at <www.jaguar.com>.
Using this combination of data sources, the
vehicle's navigation computer enables you to
plan and follow a route map to your desired
destination.
The Touch screen is used to control navigation
via menus, text screens, and map displays.
Operate the system only when it is safe
to do so.
Note: The Navigation system fitted to your
vehicle does not support speed camera alerts.
The requirements of national Road Traffic
Regulations always apply.
Observation of traffic signs and local traffic
regulations always take priority.
The Navigation system serves solely as an aid
to navigation. In particular, the Navigation
system cannot be used as an aid to orientation
when visibility is poor.
GPS signals may occasionally be interrupted
due to physical barriers, such as tunnels and
roads, under raised highways.
However, direction and speed sensors on the
vehicle will minimise any adverse effect on the
Navigation system. Normal operation will
resume once the obstruction has been passed.
Note: Some types of body-mounted accessories
(for example, external Luggage compartment
stowage devices) may affect the performance
of this system.
Under certain conditions, it is possible for the
vehicle's position shown on the screen to be
incorrect. This may happen:
•
When driving on a spiral ramp in a building.
•
When driving on or beneath elevated roads.
•
When two roads are close and parallel.
•
When the vehicle is transported to another
destination.
•
After the vehicle is rotated on a turntable.
•
After disconnection of the vehicle's battery.

USING TMC
Dynamic route guidance will calculate an
alternative route to avoid a traffic event when
the system receives an event warning. The
system calculates a new route for all sections.
However, if any waypoints are set, the system
calculates for the next waypoint. If the event on
route is serious (closed road), or if the new
route is shorter than the current one and the
current one was not recalculated within the last
5 minutes, then a message to confirm the new
route will be displayed. This pop-up message
will be displayed for 5 minutes and if the new
route is not rejected, then the vehicle will stay
on the current route.

SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
Avoid exposing the fuel gases to any
potential sources of ignition, as the
resulting fire and explosion may cause
serious injuries and/or death.
Switch off the engine when refuelling,
as it is both a source of extreme
temperatures and electrical sparks.
Switch off any personal electronic
devices such as mobile phones, or
music players.
Do not overfill the fuel tank. Overfilling
may cause spillage when the vehicle
is driven. Spillage may also occur if
the fuel expands in high ambient
temperatures.
OCTANE RATING
The minimum octane rating for fuel used is
RON (Research Octane Number). The vehicle
will run on lower ratings, but it may cause
pronounced engine knock or pinking. If the
pinking is severe, it can cause damage to the
engine, fuel, and emission control systems.
Note: Occasional, light, engine knock
experienced while accelerating or climbing hills
is acceptable.
Super Green Plus 98 RON unleaded fuel (where
available) may be used as an alternative to the
standard 95 RON unleaded fuel.
Some countries have only 91 RON fuel available.
Vehicles sold in these countries are specially
calibrated to use this fuel.
ETHANOL
This vehicle is not suitable for use with
fuels containing more than 10% ethanol.
Do not use E85 fuels (85% ethanol
content). The equipment necessary for
the use of fuels containing more than
10% ethanol is not fitted to this vehicle.
If E85 fuels are used, serious engine and
fuel system damage will occur.
Fuels containing up to 10% ethanol (grain
alcohol) may be used. Make sure that the fuel
has octane ratings no lower than those
recommended for unleaded fuel. Most drivers
will not notice any operating difference with fuel
containing ethanol. If a difference is detected,
the use of conventional unleaded fuel should
be resumed.
Brazil only
This vehicle is not suitable for use with
fuels containing more than 25% ethanol.
Vehicles intended for sale in Brazil can use E22
fuel.
METHANOL
Wherever possible, avoid using fuel
containing methanol.
Some fuels contain methanol (methyl or wood
alcohol). If you use fuels containing methanol,
the fuels must also contain co-solvents and
corrosion inhibitors for methanol. Also, do not
use fuels which contain more than 10%
methanol, even if they contain co-solvents and
corrosion inhibitors. Fuel system damage, or
vehicle performance problems resulting from
the use of such fuels, is not the responsibility
of Jaguar and may not be covered under the
warranty.
137
Fuel and refuelling

METHYL TERTIARY BUTYL ETHER
(MTBE)
Unleaded fuel containing an oxygenate known
as MTBE can be used provided that the ratio of
MTBE to conventional fuel does not exceed
15%. MTBE is an ether-based compound
derived from petroleum, which has been
specified by several refiners as the substance
to enhance the octane rating of fuel.
RUNNING OUT OF FUEL
Avoid running out of fuel!
If the vehicle does run out of fuel, a minimum
of 4 litres (0.9 gallons) will be required to restart
the engine. The vehicle should be left with the
ignition on for 5 minutes after refuelling before
attempting to restart the engine.
Note: If the vehicle does run out of fuel, seeking
qualified assistance is advisable.
FUEL FILLER FLAP
Take note of all warnings and
instructions given on the label affixed
to the inside of the filler flap.
The vehicle must be unlocked using the Smart
key before the filler flap can be opened.

1. Press and release the flap (in the area
   indicated) to unlatch.
2. Pull the flap open. The label on the inside
   of the flap indicates the correct fuel for the
   vehicle.
3. Twist the cap counter-clockwise to undo.
4. Stow the cap on the lip provided, on top of
   the hinge arm, as shown.

   Fuel and refuelling

When replacing the cap, turn it clockwise until
the ratchet clicks. Failure to do so, may cause
the engine malfunction warning lamp to
illuminate. If the warning lamp illuminates, make
sure the cap is fitted correctly.
To close the filler flap, push the flap until latched
closed.
Note: The filler flap will only be locked closed
when the vehicle is centrally locked.
FUEL FILLER
Do not attempt to fill the tank to its
maximum capacity. If the vehicle is to
be parked on a slope, in direct sunlight
or high ambient temperature,
expansion of the fuel could cause
spillage.
Check the fuel pump information
carefully to make sure that you are
putting the correct fuel into the vehicle.
If the vehicle is filled with the incorrect
fuel, it is essential that you seek qualified
assistance before you start the engine.
Fuel station pumps are equipped with automatic
cut-off sensing to avoid fuel spillage. Make sure
that the correct fuel type nozzle is fully inserted
into the filler neck and fill the tank slowly until
the filler nozzle automatically cuts off the supply.
Do not attempt to fill the tank beyond this point.
FUEL TANK CAPACITY
Avoid the risk of running out of fuel, and never
intentionally drive the vehicle when the fuel
gauge indicates that the tank is empty. When
refuelling your vehicle after the fuel gauge reads
empty, you may not be able to add the fuel
quantity shown below, as there will be a small
reserve remaining in the tank.

RUNNING-IN
This vehicle is built using high-precision
manufacturing methods, but the moving parts
of the engine must still bed-in relative to one
another. The process occurs mainly in the first
3 000 km (2 000 miles) of operation.
During this Running-in period of 3 000 km
(2 000 miles) you should:
•
Avoid frequent cold starts followed by
short-distance driving.
•
Preferably take longer trips.
•
Do not use full throttle during starts and
normal driving.
•
Avoid continuous operation at high engine
speed and abrupt stops.
•
Do not participate in track days, sports
driving schools, or similar.
In addition, specifically up to 2 000 km (1
miles):
•
Drive at varying engine and road speeds,
but do not exceed an engine speed of 4
rpm (revolutions per minute) and a road
speed of 170 km/h (105 mph).
From 2 000 km (1 200 miles) to 3 000 km
(2 000 miles):
•
Engine and road speeds can be increased
gradually.
•
Engine speeds in excess of 5 000 rpm
should only be used briefly e.g., when
overtaking.
At all times, not just during the Running-in
period:
•
Do not exceed 4 000 rpm until the engine
has reached full operating temperature.
•
Avoid labouring the engine by operating the
engine in too high a gear at low speeds.

Maintenance

REPAIRING MINOR PAINT DAMAGE
Regularly inspect the paintwork for damage.
Any stone chips, fractures, or deep scratches,
in the paint/bodywork should be repaired
promptly. Bare metal will corrode quickly, and
if left untreated can result in expensive repairs.
ALLOY WHEELS
Only use approved wheel cleaning
products.
THE EXTERIOR
Make sure the spoiler mechanism and
drainage holes are kept clean and free
of debris.
Never use cleaning products which are
not approved for use on vehicles.
Following cleaning of the vehicle
exterior, (particularly with a pressure
washer), it is recommended that the
vehicle is taken for a short drive in order
to dry out the brakes.
Some high pressure cleaning systems
are sufficiently powerful enough to
penetrate door and window seals, and
damage trim and door locks. Never aim
the water jet directly at the engine air
intake, heater air intakes, body seals, or
at any components which may be
damaged.
Some high pressure cleaning systems
are sufficiently powerful to damage the
wheels and brake system. Never aim a
water jet directly at the wheels or brakes.
Do not aim the water jet directly at any rubber
gaiters or seals on suspension joints.
Make sure that the water jet nozzle is more than
300 mm (11.8 in) away from vehicle
components.
Convertible roof:
Do not leave the convertible roof in the open
(folded) position for longer than is necessary,
as in certain circumstances, permanent soiling
along the folds may occur.
Cleaning: Every 1 600 km (1 000 miles) vacuum
clean and wash the convertible roof. Your
Dealer/Authorised Repairer will be able to
recommend suitable products.
Reproofing: Every 8 000 km (5 000 miles)
reproof the convertible roof material. Your
Dealer/Authorised Repairer will be able to
recommend suitable products.
PAINTWORK
Substances which are corrosive, such
as bird droppings, can damage the
vehicle's paintwork and should be
removed as soon as possible.
USING AN AUTOMATIC WASH
Make sure the Deployable Rear Spoiler
(DRS) is fully retracted before using a
car wash or a pressure washer. See 85,
SPOILER.
Make sure that the wipers are switched
off before entering a car wash. If the rain
sensitive wipers operate during the car
washing process, damage may occur to
the wiper mechanism. See 48, WIPER
OPERATION.
Commercially operated automatic car
washes, jet washes, and power-operated
mops, are not recommended.
Note: Regular use of automatic car washes
tends to dull the lustre of the paintwork.
After leaving the car wash, switch on the
windscreen wipers immediately, to remove
water and prevent a build up of wax.
150
Vehicle cleaning

ENGINE COMPARTMENT
Do not use a high pressure washer or
steam cleaner in the engine
compartment.
Make sure that the brake fluid reservoir
is kept dry at all times. Only use a clean,
dry cloth to clean the brake fluid cap and
reservoir.
GLASS SURFACES
Clean the rear window with a soft cloth to avoid
damaging the heating element. Do not scrape
the glass or use any abrasive cleaning fluid.
Mirror glass is particularly susceptible to
damage. Wash with soapy water. Do not use
abrasive cleaning compounds or metal scrapers
to remove ice.
REAR SCREEN
To avoid damaging the heating elements when
cleaning the inside of the rear screen, use only
a soft, damp cloth or chamois leather. Do not
use solvents or sharp objects to clean the glass.
REMOVING GREASE AND TAR
Remove grease or tar with Jaguar Tar Remover
or methylated spirit (alcohol). White spirit is
also effective, but must not be applied to rubber,
particularly the windscreen wiper blades.
Make sure that after using methylated
or white spirit, the area is washed
immediately with soapy water, to remove
all traces of spirit.
POLISHING
Chrome polish, or other abrasive
cleaners, must not be used on the
vehicle's brightwork.
It is recommended that the vehicle is polished
regularly using Jaguar polish and a polishing
cloth.
THE INTERIOR
The steering wheel centre pad, and other
areas containing airbags, should only be
cleaned sparingly with a damp cloth,
warm water, and a non-detergent soap.
LEATHER UPHOLSTERY
To prevent ingrained dirt and staining, inspect
the seat upholstery regularly and clean every
one to two months, as follows:
•
Wipe off fine dust from the seat surfaces
using a clean, damp, non-coloured cloth.
Change frequently to a clean area of cloth,
to avoid abrasive action on the leather
surface. Avoid over-wetting.
•
If this is not sufficient, use a cloth which
has been dampened with warm soapy water
and then wrung out. Use only mild
non-caustic soap.
•
Use Jaguar Leather Cleaner for heavily
soiled areas. Dry off and rub with a clean
soft cloth, changing surfaces regularly.
Use Jaguar Leather Cleaner several times a year
to maintain its appearance and suppleness. The
cleaner will nourish and moisturise, and help
to improve the surface's protective film against
dust and substances.
•
Do not use solvents. Do not use detergents,
furniture polish, or household cleaners.
While these products may initially give
impressive results, their use will lead to
rapid deterioration of the leather and will
invalidate the warranty. Jaguar recommend
a basic set of products that have been
specially selected for the type of leather in
your vehicle.
151
Vehicle cleaning

•
Dark clothing may stain leather seats, just
like other upholstery products.
•
Sharp objects, such as belts, zip fasteners,
rivets, etc., can leave permanent scratches
and scratch marks on the leather surface.
•
Unless spillages, such as tea, coffee, or ink
are washed away immediately, permanent
staining may have to be accepted.
If a valet service is used, make sure that the
specialist concerned is aware of, and follows,
these instructions precisely.
FABRIC UPHOLSTERY
Never use soap, ammonia, bleach, or
other cleaners intended for use on hard
surfaces.
Do not use upholstery cleaner on
electrical equipment such as fascia
switches.
When cleaning around electrical
equipment, such as switches, make sure
that fluids do not leak into any gaps
around the components or between
panels or trim.
Use Jaguar Upholstery Cleaner, following the
instructions. Avoid over-wetting.
REMOVING STAINS
Most stains on woollen fabric can be removed
if treatment is carried out immediately, before
the stain has a chance to dry-in.
Most stains can be treated with one of three
cleaning fluids: Jaguar Upholstery Cleaner, dry
cleaning fluid, or clean water. Follow the
instructions on the package.
INSTRUMENT PANEL, TOUCH SCREEN
AND AUDIO SYSTEM
Only use a soft, dry cloth to clean the
Instrument panel, clock, and audio equipment.
Do not use cleaning fluids or sprays.
CARPET AND MATS
Marks or stains can be removed by gentle
scrubbing with a weak solution of soap and
warm water.
For more stubborn stains, a commercially
available carpet cleaner should be used.
SEAT BELTS
Do not allow any water, cleaning
products, or fabric from cloths to enter
the seat belt mechanism. Any
substance which enters the mechanism
may affect the performance of the seat
belt in an impact.
Extend the seat belts fully, then use warm water
and a non-detergent soap to clean. Allow the
seat belts to dry naturally while fully extended,
and do not allow the belts to retract until fully
dry.
Note: While cleaning the seat belt, take the
opportunity to examine the webbing for damage
and wear. Any wear or damage should be
reported to, and rectified by, a Dealer/
Authorised Repairer.
AIRBAG MODULE COVERS
Airbag covers should only be cleaned
using a slightly dampened cloth and a
small amount of upholstery cleaner.
Any substance which enters the
mechanism, can prevent correct
deployment of an airbag during an
impact.

Vehicle cleaning

FLUID FILLER LOCATIONS
Note: The brake fluid reservoirs, for both the
left and right-hand drive vehicles are located
underneath an access cover. See 145, UNDER
BONNET COVERS - REMOVAL.

1. Brake reservoir (right-hand drive vehicles).
2. Brake reservoir (left-hand drive vehicles).
3. Engine oil.
4. Power steering reservoir.
5. Coolant reservoir (expansion tank).
6. Washer fluid reservoir.
   Do not drive the vehicle if there is a
   possibility that leaked fluid will come
   into contact with a hot surface, such
   as the exhaust.
   While working in the engine
   compartment, always observe the
   safety precautions. See 143, SAFETY
   IN THE GARAGE.
   CHECKING THE ENGINE OIL LEVEL
   The engine oil level is not monitored when the
   engine is running and/or the vehicle is in
   motion.

   Fluid level checks

The engine oil should be checked frequently and
topped up as required using the correct grade
for the engine.
Check the engine oil weekly. If any
significant or sudden drop in oil level is
noted, seek qualified assistance.
If the message ENGINE OIL PRESSURE
LOW is displayed, stop the engine as
soon as it is safe to do so, and seek
qualified assistance. Do not start the
engine until the cause has been rectified.
Prior to checking the oil level, make sure that
the vehicle is on level ground.
•
The engine oil has reached working
temperature (oil is hot).
•
The engine has been switched off for
minutes, as the system will not give an
accurate reading until the oil level has
stabilised.
The oil level can then be checked as follows:

1. Switch on the ignition (do not start the
   engine).
2. Make sure Park (P) is selected.
3. Select the Service menu using the
   Instrument panel menu control (see 35,
   INSTRUMENT PANEL MENU).
   Select Oil level display from the Service
   menu. The current oil level status and
   topping up advice is displayed in the
   Instrument panel, top up as instructed.
   An indication of the oil level is displayed in the
   gauge. Messages to the right of the gauge
   advise you of any action you may need to take.
   If the oil level is within the required operating
   range, the message Engine Oil Level OK will
   be displayed. Do not add any additional oil to
   the engine.
   If the oil level is below the required operating
   range, a message advising you of how much
   oil to add will be displayed (e.g., Add 0.5 Litre).
   Add the recommended quantity of oil.
   If the message Engine Oil Level Overfilled is
   displayed, seek qualified assistance
   immediately. Do not drive the vehicle as this
   will cause serious damage to the engine.
   If the message Engine Oil Level Underfilled is
   displayed, add 1.5 litres (2.6 pints) of oil, then
   recheck the level.
   If the message Engine Oil Level Not Available
   is displayed, the oil level is stabilising. Switch
   off the ignition, wait for 10 minutes, then
   recheck the oil level display.
   If the warning message ENGINE OIL LEVEL
   MONITOR SYSTEM FAULT is displayed, seek
   qualified assistance.
   Note: If it is necessary to check the oil level
   when the engine is hot, switch off the engine
   and let it stand for 5 minutes to allow the oil to
   drain into the sump. Do not start the engine.
   TOPPING UP THE OIL
   Failure to use an oil that meets the
   required specification could cause
   excessive engine wear, a build up of
   sludge and deposits, and increase
   pollution. It could also lead to engine
   failure. Do not use low quality or
   obsolete oils.
   Your vehicle warranty may be invalidated
   if damage is caused by using oil that
   does not meet the required specification.

   Fluid level checks

Overfilling with oil could result in severe
engine damage. Oil should be added in
small quantities and the level rechecked
to make sure that the engine is not
overfilled.
Do not use oil additives of any type, as
engine damage could occur. Use only
specified lubricants.

1. Unscrew the oil filler cap.
2. Add oil, as indicated by the Message centre
   display.
3. Wait 5 minutes for the oil level to stabilise
   and then recheck.
   It is essential to use the correct specification
   oil, and to make sure it is suitable for the
   climatic conditions in which the vehicle is to be
   operated, see 201, LUBRICANTS AND FLUIDS.
   Jaguar recommends:
   Castrol EDGE Professional
   CHECKING THE COOLANT LEVEL
   Running the engine without coolant will
   cause serious engine damage.
   If persistent coolant loss is noticed, seek
   qualified assistance immediately.
   The coolant level in the expansion tank should
   be checked at least weekly (more frequently in
   high mileage or severe operating conditions).
   Always check the level when the system is cold.
   Make sure the coolant level is maintained
   between the maximum and minimum level
   indicator marks, as illustrated.
   If the message LOW COOLANT LEVEL is
   displayed in the Message centre, stop the
   vehicle as soon as safety permits and top up
   the coolant reservoir with the recommended
   antifreeze/water mix.
   If the Message centre displays the message
   ENGINE OVERHEATING, pull off the carriageway
   and allow the engine to idle for 5 minutes and
   then switch off the ignition for 10 minutes.
   Switch on the engine and, provided that the
   warning does not occur, continue your journey,
   avoiding harsh acceleration. Seek qualified
   assistance as soon as possible.
   TOPPING UP THE COOLANT
   Never remove the filler cap when the
   engine is hot.
   Antifreeze is highly inflammable. Do
   not allow antifreeze to come into
   contact with naked flames or other
   sources of ignition (e.g., a hot engine)

- a fire may result.
  Unscrew the filler cap slowly, allowing
  the pressure to escape before removing
  completely.
  When travelling in territories where the
  water supply contains salt, always make
  sure you carry a supply of fresh (rain or
  distilled) water. Topping up with salt
  water will cause serious engine damage.

  Fluid level checks

Top up to the upper level indicator mark, located
on the side of the expansion tank. For the
coolant fluid specification, see 201,
LUBRICANTS AND FLUIDS.
Note: In an emergency, and only if the approved
antifreeze is unavailable, top up the cooling
system with clean water, but be aware of the
resultant reduction in frost protection. Do not
top up or refill with conventional antifreeze
formulations. If in doubt, consult a qualified
technician.
Make sure the cap is tightened fully after top up
is completed, by turning the cap until the ratchet
cap clicks.
CHECKING THE BRAKE FLUID LEVEL
Seek qualified assistance immediately
if brake pedal travel is unusually long,
unusually short, or if there is any
significant loss of brake fluid. Driving
under such conditions could result in
extended stopping distances or
complete brake failure.
If the quantity of fluid in the brake
reservoir drops below the
recommended level, a red warning
lamp in the Instrument panel will
illuminate and the message Brake
Fluid Low will be displayed in the
Message centre.
Note: If the warning lamp illuminates or the
message is displayed while the vehicle is being
driven, stop the vehicle as soon as safety
permits by gently applying the brakes. Check
and top up the fluid level, if necessary.
Brake fluid is highly toxic - keep
containers sealed and out of the reach
of children. If accidental consumption
is suspected, seek medical attention
immediately.
If the fluid comes into contact with the
skin or eyes, rinse immediately with
plenty of clean water.
Brake fluid is highly inflammable. Do
not allow brake fluid to come into
contact with naked flames or other
sources of ignition (e.g., a hot engine).
Do not drive the vehicle with the fluid
level below the MIN mark.
With the vehicle on level ground, check the fluid
level at least every week (more frequently in
high mileage or arduous operating conditions).
The brake fluid level should be between the MIN
and the MAX marks on the side of the reservoir.
The fluid level may drop slightly during normal
use, as a result of brake pad wear, but should
not be allowed to drop below the MIN mark.
TOPPING UP THE BRAKE FLUID
Brake fluid will damage painted surfaces.
Soak up any spillage with an absorbent
cloth immediately, and wash the area
with a mixture of car shampoo and
water.
Only use new fluid from an airtight
container (fluid from open containers or
fluid previously bled from the system,
will have absorbed moisture, which will
adversely affect performance and must
not be used).

Fluid level checks

1. Clean the filler cap with a clean, dry cloth
   before removing, to prevent dirt or moisture
   from entering the reservoir.
2. Remove the filler cap.
3. Top up the reservoir with the specified brake
   fluid to at least the MIN mark. See 201,
   LUBRICANTS AND FLUIDS.
   Do not top up the brake fluid to the MAX
   mark unless the brake pads have been
   replaced. If in doubt, seek qualified
   assistance.
4. Replace the cap.
5. Refit the under bonnet cover. See 146,
   UNDER BONNET COVERS - REFITTING.
   CHECKING THE POWER STEERING
   FLUID LEVEL
   Power steering fluid is highly toxic.
   Keep containers sealed and out of the
   reach of children. If accidental
   consumption of fluid is suspected, seek
   medical attention immediately.
   If the fluid comes into contact with the
   skin or eyes, rinse immediately with
   plenty of clean water.
   Power steering fluid is highly
   inflammable. Do not allow power
   steering fluid to come into contact with
   naked flames or other sources of
   ignition (e.g., a hot engine).
   The engine must not be started if the
   fluid level has dropped below the MIN
   mark.
   Seek qualified assistance immediately if
   there is a noticeable drop in the fluid
   level.
   If fluid loss is slow, the reservoir may
   be topped up to the upper level mark to
   enable the vehicle to be driven to a repair
   facility for examination. However, it is
   recommended that you seek qualified
   assistance before driving the vehicle.
   Check and top up the fluid with the vehicle on
   level ground, with the engine switched off, and
   the system cold. Make sure that the steering
   wheel is not turned after stopping the engine.
   The level of fluid can be seen through the
   translucent body of the reservoir, see 153,
   FLUID FILLER LOCATIONS.
   The fluid level should be between the MIN and
   the MAX marks.
   TOPPING UP THE POWER STEERING
   FLUID
   It is imperative that the power steering
   system does not become contaminated
   in any way. Always use new fluid and
   clean the area around the filler neck,
   both before removing the filler cap and
   after topping up. Never return drained
   fluid to the system.
   Power steering fluid will damage painted
   surfaces. Soak up any spillage with an
   absorbent cloth immediately, and wash
   the area with a mixture of car shampoo
   and water.
6. Clean the filler cap before removing, to
   prevent dirt from entering the reservoir.
7. Remove the filler cap.
8. Top up the reservoir until the fluid level is
   between the MIN and MAX marks. See 201,
   LUBRICANTS AND FLUIDS for the power
   steering fluid specification.
9. Replace the filler cap.

   Fluid level checks

CHECKING THE WASHER FLUID LEVEL
Do not allow screen washer fluid to
come into contact with naked flames
or sources of ignition.
If the vehicle is operated in
temperatures below 4°C (40°F), use a
washer fluid with frost protection.
Only use approved washer fluid.
Take care to avoid spillage, particularly
if an undiluted or high concentration is
being used. If spillage occurs, wash the
affected area immediately with clean
water.
The washer reservoir supplies the windscreen
and headlamp washer jets.
The Message centre will display a message
when the washer bottle requires more fluid. See
35, INSTRUMENT PANEL MENU.
Operate the washers periodically, to check that
the nozzles are clear and properly directed.
TOPPING UP THE WASHER FLUID

1. Clean the filler cap before opening, to
   prevent dirt from entering the reservoir.
2. Open the filler cap.
3. Top up the reservoir with the specified
   washer fluid until the fluid is visible in the
   filler neck. See 201, LUBRICANTS AND
   FLUIDS.
4. Close the filler cap.

   Fluid level checks

BATTERY WARNING SYMBOLS
Do not allow naked flames or other
sources of ignition near the battery,
as the battery may emit explosive
gases.
Make sure that when working near
or handling the battery, suitable eye
protection is worn, to protect the
eyes from acid splashes.
To prevent risk of injury, do not
allow children near the battery.
Be aware that the battery may emit
explosive gases.
The battery contains acid which is
extremely corrosive and toxic.
Consult the handbook for
information, before handling the
battery.
BATTERY CARE
If battery electrolyte comes into contact
with your eyes, skin, or clothes you
should remove the affected clothing
and flush the skin/eyes with copious
amounts of clean water. Seek medical
assistance immediately.
If swallowed, battery electrolyte can
be fatal, seek medical assistance
immediately.
Do not connect any 12-volt equipment
directly to the battery terminals. Doing
so may cause a spark, which can result
in an explosion.
The cell plugs and vent pipe must be
in place at all times when the battery
is connected to the vehicle. Make sure
that the vent pipe is clear of
obstructions and not kinked. Failure to
do so may cause a pressure build up
in the battery, resulting in an
explosion.
Do not expose the battery to a naked
flame or spark, as the battery produces
explosive, flammable gas.
Never jump start (boost), charge, or
try to start a vehicle with a frozen
battery. Doing so can result in an
explosion.
Remove all metal jewellery before
working on, or near, the battery, and
never allow metal tools or vehicle
components to come into contact with

surfaces. If battery electrolyte comes
into contact with any surface, the surface
should be washed down immediately
with copious amounts of clean water.
159
Vehicle battery

Your vehicle battery will be either:

1. Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM) battery. These
   are sealed for life and require no
   maintenance.
   Do not attempt to open or remove the
   top from an AGM battery.
2. Low maintenance battery. The battery cells’
   electrolyte levels can be checked and topped
   up.
   Remove the Luggage compartment, left-side
   cover to access the battery.
   In hot climates, more frequent checks of the
   battery electrolyte level and condition are
   required. If necessary, the battery cells can be
   topped up using distilled water.
   BATTERY MONITORING SYSTEM
   If excessive battery discharge occurs, the
   Intelligent Power System Management (IPSM)
   will begin to shut down non-essential electrical
   systems to protect battery power.
   If the message Energy Management is
   displayed on the Touch screen while the engine
   is switched off, after 3 minutes, IPSM will begin
   a shut down operation. Normal system function
   will resume when the engine is started.
   If the message Low Battery - Please Start
   Engine is displayed on the Touch screen and in
   the Message centre while the engine is switched
   off, after 3 minutes, IPSM will begin a shut
   down operation. The Message centre will
   continue to display the message until either the
   vehicle is completely turned off or the engine
   is started. Normal system function will resume
   when the engine is started.
   Note: If the message Low Battery - Please Start
   Engine is displayed, drive the vehicle for at least
   30 minutes in temperatures above 0°C (32°F)
   or at least 60 minutes if temperatures are below
   0°C (32°F). This will allow the battery to recover
   to an acceptable level.

TYRE MARKINGS

1. P indicates that the tyre is for passenger
   vehicle use. This index is not always shown.
2. The width of the tyre from sidewall edge to
   sidewall edge in millimetres.
3. The aspect ratio, also known as the profile,
   gives the sidewall height as a percentage of
   the tread width. So, if the tread width is
   mm and the aspect ratio is 50, the sidewall
   height will be 102 mm.
4. R indicates that the tyre is of Radial ply
   construction.
5. The diameter of the wheel rim (given in
   inches).
6. The load index for the tyre. This index is not
   always shown.
   The load index on all replacement tyres
   should be, at least, the same
   specification as the Original Equipment
   (OE). If in doubt, consult a
   Dealer/Authorised Repairer.
7. The speed rating denotes the maximum
   speed at which the tyre should be used for
   extended periods. See 177, SPEED RATING.
8. Tyre manufacturing standard information,
   which can be used for tyre recalls and other
   checking processes. Most of this
   information relates to the manufacturer,
   place of manufacture etc. The last four
   numbers are the date of manufacture. For
   example, if the number was 3106, the tyre
   was made in the 31st week of 2006.
9. M+S or M/S indicates that the tyre has been
   designed with some capability for mud and
   snow.

   Tyres

10. The number of plies in both the tread area,
    and the sidewall area, indicates how many
    layers of rubber-coated material make up
    the structure of the tyre. Information is also
    provided on the type of materials used.
11. Wear rate indicator: A tyre rated at 400, for
    example, will last longer than a tyre rated
    at 200.
12. The traction rating grades a tyres
    performance when stopping on a wet road
    surface. The higher the grade, the better the
    braking performance. The grades, from
    highest to lowest are; AA, A, B and C.
13. The maximum load which can be carried by
    the tyre.
14. Heat resistance grading. The tyre's
    resistance to heat is grade A, B or C, with
    A indicating the greatest resistance to heat.
    This grading is provided for a correctly
    inflated tyre, which is being used within its
    speed and loading limits.
15. The maximum inflation pressure for the
    tyre. This pressure should not be used for
    normal driving. See 177, TYRE CARE.

    TYRE CARE
    Do not drive the vehicle if a tyre is
    damaged, excessively worn, or
    incorrectly inflated.
    Avoid contaminating the tyres with
    vehicle fluids as they may cause
    damage to the tyre.
    Avoid spinning the wheels. The forces
    released can damage the structure of
    the tyre and cause it to fail.
    If wheel spin is unavoidable due to a
    loss of traction (in deep snow, for
    example), do not exceed 50 km/h (30
    mph).
    Do not exceed the maximum pressure
    stated on the sidewall of the tyre.
    All of the vehicle's tyres (including the spare)
    should be checked regularly for damage, wear,
    and distortion. If you are in any doubt about the
    condition of a tyre, have it checked immediately
    by a tyre repair centre or a Dealer/Authorised
    Repairer.
    TYRE PRESSURES
    All tyre pressures should be checked
    regularly using an accurate pressure
    gauge, when the tyres are cold.
    Pressure checks should only be carried
    out when the tyres are cold, and the
    vehicle has been stationary for more
    than 3 hours. A hot tyre at or below
    recommended cold inflation pressure
    is dangerously under-inflated.
    Never drive your vehicle if the tyre
    pressures are incorrect. Under-inflation
    causes excessive flexing and uneven
    tyre wear. This can lead to sudden tyre
    failure. Over-inflation causes harsh
    ride, uneven tyre wear, and poor
    handling.

    Tyres

Under-inflation also reduces fuel
efficiency and tyre tread life and may
affect the vehicle’s handling and
stopping ability.
If the vehicle has been parked in strong
sunlight, or used in high ambient
temperatures, do not reduce the tyre
pressures. Move the vehicle into the
shade and allow the tyres to cool
before rechecking the pressures.
The recommended tyre pressures are listed on
a label located in the driver’s door opening.
Check the tyres, including the spare, for
condition and pressure on a weekly basis and
before long journeys.
The tyre pressures can be displayed in the
Message centre using the Vehicle Info and Tyre
Pressure Check Instrument panel menus. See
35, INSTRUMENT PANEL MENU. The display
will show 2 tyre pressures for each tyre. The
upper figure is the current tyre pressure and
the lower figure (in brackets) is the
recommended tyre pressure. Selecting
Handbook Pressures, via the Vehicle Info and
Tyre Pressures menus, will display all the
handbook tyre pressures.
Note: The tyre pressure units can be configured
to display as either bar, psi, or kPa via the
Pressure Units menu.
If tyre pressures are checked while the vehicle
is inside a protected covered area (e.g., a
garage) and subsequently driven in lower
outdoor temperatures, tyre under-inflation could
occur.
A slight pressure loss occurs naturally with
time. If this exceeds 0.14 bar (2 psi, 14 kPa,)
per week, have the cause investigated and
rectified by qualified assistance.
If it is necessary to check tyre pressures when
the tyres are warm, you should expect the
pressures to have increased by up to 0.3 - 0.4
bar (4 - 6 psi, 30 - 40 kpa). Do not reduce the
tyre pressures to the cold inflation pressure
under these circumstances. Allow the tyres to
cool fully before adjusting the pressures.
The following procedure should be used to
check and adjust the tyre pressures:
To avoid damaging the valves, do not
apply excessive force or sideways force
on the gauge/inflator.

1. Remove the valve cap.
2. Firmly attach a tyre pressure gauge/inflator
   to the valve.
3. Read the tyre pressure from the gauge, and
   add air if required.
4. If air is added to the tyre, remove the gauge
   and re-attach it before reading the pressure.
   Failure to do so may result in an inaccurate
   reading.
5. If the tyre pressure is too high, remove the
   gauge and allow air out of the tyre by
   pressing the centre of the valve. Refit the
   gauge to the valve and check the pressure.
6. Repeat the process, adding or removing air
   as required, until the correct tyre pressure
   is reached.

  Tyres

Closed road use - cold tyre pressures (high
performance tyres with 20 inch wheel rims
only)
High performance tyres have less tread
depth and different performance
properties to those supplied with other
Jaguar vehicles.
High performance tyres are designed to
optimise vehicle performance in dry
conditions. Vehicle stability is reduced
in wet conditions, increasing the risk of
an accident (for example, aquaplaning).
Reduce speed when driving on wet
surfaces.
Closed road use - cold tyre pressures
Tyre pressures
Vehicle position

- 2.2 bar (32 psi, 220 kPa)
  Front axle
- 2.0 bar (29 psi, 200 kPa)
  Rear axle
- These lower cold tyre pressures will
  compensate for a pressure increase due to a
  temperature increase during continuous high
  speed driving on closed roads.
  Note: The tyre pressures specified above, for
  closed road use on high performance tyres, may
  trigger the tyre pressure warning message. If
  this occurs then the vehicle user must satisfy
  themselves that the tyres are adequately inflated
  for the conditions of use.
  Make sure the high performance tyre
  pressures are returned to the public road
  use-cold tyre pressures before returning
  the vehicle to public road use.
  TYRE VALVES
  Keep the valve caps screwed down firmly, to
  prevent water or dirt from entering the valve.
  Check the valves for leaks when checking the
  tyre pressures.
  PUNCTURED TYRES
  Do not drive the vehicle with a
  punctured tyre. Even if the punctured
  tyre has not deflated, it is unsafe to
  use, as the tyre may deflate suddenly
  at any time.
  REPLACEMENT TYRES
  The load and speed index ratings on
  all replacement tyres must be, at least,
  the same specification as the Original
  Equipment (OE). If in doubt, consult a
  Dealer/Authorised Repairer.
  If lower speed rated specialist tyres
  are fitted (e.g., winter tyres or off road
  tyres), then the vehicle must be driven
  within the speed limitations of the
  tyres. Consult your Dealer/Authorised
  Repairer for further information. In
  markets that require a tyre's maximum
  speed label to be fitted, the tyre's
  maximum speed label should be
  placed within the driver's field of
  vision. These can be obtained from the
  tyre dealer.
  Always fit replacement tyres of the
  same type, and wherever possible, of
  the same make, and tread pattern.
  Do not rotate tyres around the vehicle.
  If the use of tyres not recommended by
  Jaguar is unavoidable, make sure that
  you read, and fully comply with, the
  tyre manufacturer’s instructions.

  Tyres

When the tread has worn down to approximately
2 mm, wear indicators start to appear at the
surface of the tread pattern. This produces a
continuous band of rubber across the tread, as
a visual reminder.
Ideally, tyres should be replaced in sets of 4. If
this is not possible, replace the tyres in pairs
(both front or both rear tyres). When tyres are
replaced, the wheels should always be
re-balanced and the alignment checked.
The correct tyre specification for your vehicle
can be found on the tyre placard label. See 177,
TYRE PRESSURES.
PRESSURE COMPENSATION FOR
TEMPERATURE CHANGES
A colder ambient local temperature will reduce
pressure within the tyre. An effect is to decrease
sidewall height and to increase tyre shoulder
wear with the potential for tyre failure. Vehicle
dynamics could also be adversely affected.
Tyre pressures can be adjusted to compensate
before the start of the journey. Alternatively,
tyre pressures can be adjusted when the area
of lower ambient temperature is reached.
In this situation, the vehicle must be left in the
ambient local temperature for at least one hour
before the tyre pressure is adjusted.
To compensate for colder ambient
temperatures, tyre pressures should be
increased by 0.14 bar (2psi, 14 kPa) for each
10°C (20°F) decrease.
Note: Make sure that the correct tyre pressures
are maintained when moving to areas of
differing ambient temperature.
AVOIDING FLAT SPOTS
In areas of extended high ambient temperature,
vehicle tyres can be affected by a softening of
the tyre sidewall. If the vehicle is stationary for
long periods, the effect is to slightly deform the
tyre at the point where the tyre meets the
standing surface. This is known as a flat spot.
This is normal tyre behaviour. However, when
the vehicle is subsequently driven, vibration
may be experienced from the flat spot. The
condition will steadily improve with additional
mileage.
In order to minimise flat spotting, the tyre
pressures can be increased to the maximum,
as stated on the tyre sidewall. Tyres must be
returned to the specified running pressures
before driving. See 177, TYRE PRESSURES.
TYRE DEGRADATION
Tyres degrade over time due to the effects of
ultraviolet light, extreme temperatures, high
loads, and environmental conditions. It is
recommended that tyres are replaced at least
every 6 years, but they may require replacement
more frequently.
USING WINTER TYRES
In many countries, legislation exists that
requires the use of winter tyres during specified
periods of the year.
Note: M+S (mud and snow) tyres have a
recognised level of winter performance and need
not be replaced.
The M+S marking on the tyre sidewall indicates
an 'all season' tyre designed for use all year
round, including cold temperatures, snow, and
ice.
181
Tyres

Note: A dedicated winter tyre often has a lower
speed rating than the original equipment tyre,
and the vehicle must therefore be driven within
the speed limitation of the tyre. Consult your
Dealer/Authorised Repairer for further
information. In markets that require a tyre's
maximum speed label to be fitted, the tyre's
maximum speed label should be placed within
the driver's field of vision. These can be
obtained from the tyre dealer.
This symbol identifies dedicated
winter tyres, which can be fitted if
optimum winter traction is required,
or the vehicle is to be used in more
extreme winter conditions.
Winter tyres must be fitted to all 4 wheels.
For optimum traction, tyres should be run in for
at least 160 kilometres (100 miles) on dry
roads, prior to driving on snow or ice.
Use of dedicated winter tyres may require a
change of wheel size, depending on the original
choice of wheel. All 4 wheels must be changed.
If fitted with standard rubber valves, the Tyre
Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) warning
lamp will flash for 75 seconds and then remain
illuminated. The Message centre will also
display TYRE PRESSURE MONITORING
SYSTEM FAULT.
When the original wheels and tyres are refitted,
the vehicle will need to travel a short distance
to reset the TPMS and extinguish the warning
lamp.

USING SNOW CHAINS
It is essential that only snow chains of
the recommended type are fitted.
Snow chains can only be fitted to the rear
wheels. They should not be used on
temporary-use spare wheels.
Contact a Dealer/Authorised Repairer for details
and availability of approved snow chains.
The maximum speed when using snow chains
is 50 km/h (30 mph).
182
Tyres

Note: When using snow chains, select
Rain/Ice/Snow mode, see 82, JAGUARDRIVE
CONTROL, and switch DSC off. See 81,
SWITCHING DSC OFF. DSC reduces deep snow
traction capability, as it limits wheel spin to a
level below that which is required to generate
maximum traction.
TYRE DECLARATION (India only)
All imported tyres meet the requirements of
Bureau of India Standards (BIS) and comply
with the requirements under Central Motor
Vehicle Rules (CMVR) 1989. The tyres are the

TYRE PRESSURE MONITORING
SYSTEM
TPMS provides a low pressure warning
and does not re-inflate your tyres. Tyre
pressures should be checked regularly,
using an accurate pressure gauge when
the tyres are cold.
TPMS can NOT register damage to a
tyre. Regularly check the condition of
your tyres, especially if the vehicle is
driven off-road.
When inflating tyres, care should be
taken to avoid bending or damaging the
TPMS valves. Always confirm correct
alignment of the inflation head to the
valve stem.
Note: Different types of tyre may affect TPMS
performance. Always replace tyres in
accordance with recommendations.
TPMS constantly monitors the tyre pressure in
each wheel except, for the temporary-use spare
tyre (when fitted) which is not monitored.
Wheels fitted with TPMS can be visually
identified by the external metal lock nut and
valve (1). All Jaguar non-TPMS wheels have a
rubber valve fitted (2).
Tyre pressures should be checked regularly
when the tyres are cold, and adjusted as
necessary. The presence of TPMS does not
remove the need to do this.
The tyre pressure warning lamp, see 40, TYRE
PRESSURE MONITORING SYSTEM (YELLOW),
illuminates when one or more of the tyres are
significantly under-inflated. In addition to this,
a warning message and the current pressure,
is displayed in the Message centre below a
graphic which shows which tyre is
under-inflated. Stop and check the tyres as soon
as possible and inflate them to the
recommended pressure.
Vehicles supplied with 20 inch wheels also have
a speed based TPMS system. If the vehicle is
required to travel at speeds of over 250 km/h
(155 mph), the tyre pressures should be raised.
See 177, TYRE PRESSURES. Failure to do this
may cause the warning message TYRE
PRESSURES LOW FOR SPEED to be displayed
in the Message centre.
Note: Make sure to set the tyre pressures to the
correct pressure when the vehicle will be
travelling at speeds of less than 250 km/h (155
mph).
TEMPORARY USE SPARE WHEEL AND
TYRE CHANGE
If the temporary-use spare wheel is fitted, the
system will automatically recognise the change
in wheel positions. After approximately
minutes of driving above 25 km/h (18 mph),
the message FRONT[REAR] RIGHT[LEFT] TYRE
PRESSURE NOT MONITORED will be displayed,
accompanied by illumination of the warning
lamp.
184
Tyre pressure monitoring system (TPMS)

The warning lamp will first flash and then
illuminate continuously. Extended use of the
temporary-use spare wheel will trigger the
message TYRE PRESSURE MONITORING
SYSTEM FAULT.
This TPMS display sequence will be activated
at every ignition cycle until the temporary spare
wheel is replaced by a full size road wheel with
a TPMS sensor fitted.
Note: If in use, always replace the temporary
spare wheel before having a TPMS fault
investigated.

TYRE REPAIR KIT
If you are in any doubt regarding your
ability to carry out the instructions,
contact a Dealer/Authorised Repairer
before attempting the repair.
Your vehicle may not be equipped with a spare
tyre. Alternatively your vehicle will be fitted with
a tyre repair kit which can be used to repair one
tyre. It is essential that you read the following
guide before attempting to repair a tyre.
The tyre repair kit consists of a canister of
sealant located below the Luggage compartment
left-side (battery) cover, in front of the vehicle's
battery as shown, and a compressor located in
the Luggage compartment.
Note: Vehicles with carbon ceramic brake discs
are supplied with two wheel guide pins. The
pins are stored with the compressor.
The tyre repair kit seals most punctures with a
maximum diameter of 6 mm (1/4 inch).
The tyre repair kit is located under the floor
panel in the Luggage compartment. If required,
also remove the Luggage compartment left-side
(battery) cover.
Note: The sealant used in the tyre repair kit has
a shelf life and the expiry date is shown on the
tyre sealant bottle. Make sure the container is
replaced before the expiry date.
TYRE REPAIR KIT SAFETY
INFORMATION
Some tyre damage may only be
partially sealed, or may not seal at all,
depending on the amount and type of
damage. Any loss of tyre pressure can
seriously affect vehicle safety.
Do not use the tyre repair kit if the tyre
has been damaged by driving while
under-inflated.
A - Tyre tread area.
Only use the tyre repair kit to seal
damage located within the tyre tread
area (A).
Do not exceed 80 km/h (50 mph) when
a repaired tyre is fitted to the vehicle.
The maximum distance that should be
driven when a repaired tyre is fitted,
is 200 km (125 miles).
When a repaired tyre is fitted, drive
with caution and avoid sudden braking
or steering manoeuvres.
186
Tyre repair kit

Only use the tyre repair kit for the
vehicle with which it was supplied.
Do not use the tyre repair kit for any
other purpose than tyre repair.
Never leave the tyre repair kit
unattended, when in use.
Only use the tyre repair kit within the

- 30°C to +70°C temperature range.
  Always keep children and animals at
  a safe distance from the tyre repair kit,
  when in use.
  Do not stand directly beside the
  compressor when it is operating.
  Check the tyre sidewall prior to
  inflation. If any cracks, damage, or
  deformities are apparent, do not inflate
  the tyre.
  Watch the tyre sidewall during
  inflation. If any cracks, bumps, or
  similar damage, or deformities appear,
  switch off the compressor and deflate
  the tyre.
  USING THE TYRE REPAIR KIT
  Avoid skin contact with the sealant
  which contains natural rubber latex.
  If the tyre inflation pressure does not
  reach 1.8 bar (26 psi, 180 kPa) within
  a maximum of 10 minutes, the tyre
  may have suffered excessive damage.
  A temporary repair will not be
  possible, and the vehicle should not
  be driven until the tyre has been
  replaced.
  Before attempting a tyre repair, make
  sure that the vehicle is parked safely, as
  far away from passing traffic as possible.
  Make sure that the Parking brake is
  applied and P (Park) is selected.
  Do not attempt to remove foreign
  objects, such as nails, screws, etc. from
  the tyre.
  Never start the engine and leave it
  running when the vehicle is in an
  enclosed space. Exhaust gases are
  poisonous and cause unconsciousness
  and death, if inhaled.
  To prevent overheating, do not operate
  the compressor continuously for longer
  than 10 minutes.
  Note: All vehicle drivers and occupants should
  be made aware that a temporary repair has been
  made to a tyre fitted to the vehicle. They should
  also be made aware of the special driving
  conditions imposed when using a repaired tyre.
  REPAIR PROCEDURE
  Check the tyre sidewall prior to
  inflation. If there are any cracks,
  bumps, or similar damage, do not
  attempt to inflate the tyre. Do not stand
  directly beside the tyre while the
  compressor is pumping. Watch the tyre
  sidewall. If any cracks, bumps, or
  similar damage appear, turn off the
  compressor and let the air out by
  means of the pressure relief valve. Do
  not continue to use the tyre.
  If the tyre inflation pressure does not
  reach 1.8 bar (26 psi, 180 kPa) within
  a maximum of 10 minutes, the tyre
  may have suffered excessive damage.
  A temporary repair will not be
  possible, and the vehicle should not
  be driven until the tyre has been
  replaced.

  Tyre repair kit

1. Open the tyre repair kit and peel off the
   maximum speed label. Attach the label to
   the fascia, in the driver's field of vision. Take
   care not to obstruct any of the instruments
   or warning lamps.
2. Uncoil the compressor power cable and the
   inflation hose.
3. Unscrew the orange cap from the sealant
   bottle receiver and the sealant bottle cap.
4. Screw the sealant bottle into the receiver
   (clockwise) until tight.
   Note: Screwing the bottle onto the receiver
   will pierce the bottle's seal. Once the
   receiver has been fitted, a ratchet prevents
   it from being removed.
5. Remove the valve cap from the damaged
   tyre.
6. Remove the protective cap from the inflation
   hose. Connect the inflation hose to the tyre
   valve making sure that the hose is screwed
   on firmly.
7. Making sure that the compressor switch is
   in the Off (0) position, insert the power
   cable connector into an auxiliary power
   socket. See 234, DRIVER CONTROLS.
   Then switch on the ignition. See 73,
   SWITCHING ON THE IGNITION.
8. Switch on the compressor by positioning
   the switch to the (l) position.
9. Inflate the tyre to a minimum of 1.8 bar (26
   psi, 180 kPa) and a maximum of 3.5 bar
   (51 psi, 350 kPa).
   Note: When pumping the sealant through
   the tyre valve, the pressure may rise up to
   6 bar (87 psi, 600 kPa). The pressure will
   drop again after approximately 30 seconds.
10. During the inflation, switch the compressor
    off briefly, to check the tyre pressure using
    the gauge mounted on the compressor.
    Note: It should not take longer than
    minutes to inflate the tyre. If, after a
    maximum of 10 minutes, the tyre has not
    yet reached minimum pressure, the tyre
    should not be used.
11. Once the tyre has been inflated to the
    required pressure, switch off the
    compressor. If desired, the ignition may be
    turned off after the compressor has been
    turned off.
12. Remove the power connector from the
    auxiliary power socket.
13. Remove the inflation hose from the tyre
    valve, by unscrewing it as quickly as
    possible (counter-clockwise).
14. Replace the inflation hose protective cap
    and the tyre valve cap.
15. Make sure that the tyre repair kit (including
    the bottle and receiver caps) are placed
    securely in the vehicle. You will need to use
    the kit to check the tyre pressure after a
    maximum of 10 km (6 miles), so make sure
    that they are easily accessible.
16. Immediately drive the vehicle for a
    maximum of 10 km (6 miles), to allow the
    sealant to coat the inner surface of the tyre
    and form a seal at the puncture.
    CHECKING THE TYRE PRESSURE
    AFTER A REPAIR
    When driving the vehicle, if you
    experience vibrations, abnormal
    steering, or noises, reduce speed
    immediately. Drive with extreme
    caution and reduced speed, to the first
    safe place to stop the vehicle. Visually
    examine the tyre and check its
    pressure. If there are any signs of
    damage or deformity to the tyre, or the
    tyre pressure is below 1.3 bar (19 psi,
    130 kPa), do not continue driving.

    Tyre repair kit

Consult a tyre repair centre or a
Dealer/Authorised Repairer, for advice
concerning the replacement of a tyre
after using a tyre repair kit.

1. Drive the vehicle for a maximum of 10 km
   (6 miles) then stop in a safe place. Carry
   out a visual examination of the tyre’s
   condition.
2. Remove the repair kit from the vehicle.
3. Screw the inflation hose connector firmly
   onto the tyre valve.
4. Read the tyre pressure from the gauge.
5. If the pressure of the sealant filled tyre is
   above 1.3 bar (19 psi, 130 kPa), adjust the
   pressure to the correct value.
6. Make sure that the compressor switch is in
   the off (O) position and insert the power
   cable connector into the auxiliary power
   socket.
   Then switch on the ignition.
7. Switch the compressor to on (I) and inflate
   the tyre to the correct pressure. See 177,
   TYRE PRESSURES.
8. To check the tyre pressure, turn off the
   compressor and then read the pressure
   from the gauge.
9. When the compressor is off, if the tyre
   pressure is too high, release the required
   amount of pressure using the pressure
   release valve.
10. Once the tyre is inflated to the correct
    pressure, switch off the compressor and
    remove the power plug from the auxiliary
    socket.
    Note: The use of the tyre repair kit sealant
    may lead to error prompts and incorrect
    readings of the Tyre Pressure Monitoring
    System (TPMS); therefore, use the tyre
    repair kit pressure gauge to check and
    adjust the damaged tyre's inflation pressure.
11. Unscrew the inflation hose connector from
    the tyre valve, replace the tyre valve cap and
    the inflation hose connector protective cap.
12. Make sure that the tyre repair kit is placed
    securely in the vehicle.
13. Drive to the nearest tyre repair centre or
    Dealer/Authorised Repairer, for a
    replacement tyre to be fitted. Make sure that
    you inform the repair centre that the tyre
    repair kit has been used before the tyre is
    removed.
14. The tyre inflation hose, the receiver, and the
    sealant bottle must be replaced once a new
    tyre has been fitted.
    Only sealant bottles which are
    completely empty should be
    disposed of with normal household
    waste. Sealant bottles which contain
    some sealant, and the tyre inflation
    hose, should be disposed of by a
    tyre specialist or your
    Dealer/Authorised Repairer in
    compliance with local waste disposal
    regulations.

WHEEL CHANGING SAFETY
Before raising the vehicle, or changing a wheel,
make sure that you read, and comply with the
following warnings.
Always find a safe place to stop, off the
road and away from traffic.
Make sure that the vehicle and jack are
both on firm, level ground.
Apply the Parking brake and engage
Park (P).
Switch on the hazard warning lamps.
Make sure that the front wheels are in
the straight ahead position, and
engage the steering lock.
Make sure that all passengers, and
animals, are out of the vehicle and in
a safe place away from the road.
Place a warning triangle at a suitable
distance behind the vehicle, facing
towards oncoming traffic.
When one rear wheel is lifted off of the
ground, the selection of Park (P) will
not prevent the vehicle from moving
and possibly slipping off of the jack,
as the Parking brake only operates on
the rear wheels.
Always chock the wheel diagonally
opposite the wheel to be changed,
using the wheel chock supplied in the
tool kit. Chock the front of a front
wheel, or the rear of a rear wheel.
If jacking the vehicle on a slight slope
is unavoidable, place the chocks on
the downhill side of the two opposite
wheels. An additional chock will be
needed.
Never place anything between the jack
and the ground, or the jack and the
vehicle.
Do not attempt to raise the vehicle
unless the jack head is fully engaged
in the jacking point. Only jack the
vehicle using the approved jacking
points.
Remove the spare wheel prior to
jacking the vehicle, to avoid
destabilising the vehicle when raised.
Take care when lifting the spare wheel,
and removing the punctured wheel.
The wheels are heavy and can cause
injuries if not handled correctly.
Do not start or run the engine while the
vehicle is supported only by a jack.
WARNING - THAT NO PERSON SHOULD
PLACE ANY PORTION OF THEIR BODY
UNDER A VEHICLE THAT IS
SUPPORTED BY A JACK.
Take care when loosening the wheel
nuts. The wheel brace may slip off if
not properly attached, and the wheel
nuts may release suddenly. Either
unexpected movement may cause an
injury.
After use, the tool kit should be
returned to the under floor storage area
and correctly stowed.
Always make sure replacement tyres
have the correct rating and
specifications (e.g., load index, size,
speed rating) for your vehicle.

Carbon ceramic brake discs are
susceptible to damage. Take care not to
damage the brake discs when removing
and refitting the road wheels.
Vehicles with carbon ceramic brake

186, TYRE REPAIR KIT. Make sure that
the 2 wheel guide pins are used to aid
removing and refitting of road wheels
on vehicles with carbon ceramic brake
discs.
Note: Vehicles with a convertible roof do not
facilitate stowage of a full size wheel and tyre.
Open the Luggage compartment lid, see 10,
OPENING AND CLOSING THE LUGGAGE
COMPARTMENT.

1. Spare wheel retaining bolt and clamp.
2. Jack: Observe the instructions printed on
   the jack.
3. Wheel brace.
4. Wheel chock.
   To remove the spare wheel and tool tray,
   unscrew and remove the retaining bolt and
   clamp (1).
   Before raising the vehicle, use the wheel nut
   brace to slacken the wheel nuts half a turn
   counter-clockwise.
   Note: The locking wheel nut adaptor will be
   required to slacken and remove the locking
   wheel nut. The locking wheel nut adaptor is
   located next to the vehicle's battery, see 192,
   LOCKING WHEEL NUTS.
   There are 4 jacking points on the underside of
   the floor. Two indented, triangular indicators
   are provided on each sill cover. These indicate
   the location for the jack.
   Raise the vehicle with the jack until the tyre
   being lifted just clears the ground. Operate the
   jack with a slow and steady motion. Avoid
   sudden and erratic actions as they may cause
   the vehicle/jack to become unstable.

   Wheel changing

On vehicles with carbon ceramic brake discs,
remove 2 opposing wheel nuts and install the
2 wheel guide pins, as shown.
Remove the remaining wheel nuts and carefully
remove the road wheel.
Note: To remove the centre badge, use the
plastic tipped end of the wheel nut wrench
handle, push the centre badge from its housing
from the inside of the wheel.
Do not remove the two wheel guide pins
from the vehicle until the wheel has been
lightly tightened with 3 wheel nuts.
Using the wheel nut wrench, lightly tighten the
wheel nuts alternately, using the sequence
shown in the illustration.
Lower the jack, then tighten the wheel nuts fully,
in the same sequence shown. Do not
overtighten by using foot pressure or extension
bars on the wheel nut wrench.
At the earliest opportunity, have the wheel nuts
tightened with a torque wrench to 125 Nm (92
lb.ft).
This torque must not be exceeded.
LOCKING WHEEL NUTS
The locking wheel nut adaptor is located in the
Luggage compartment, next to the vehicle's

compartment. It should be removed and stored
in the position shown, as soon as possible.
192
Wheel changing

Note: A code number is stamped onto the
underside of the adaptor. This number should
be recorded in the Service Portfolio, supplied
with the literature pack. If a replacement adaptor
is required, you will be asked to quote this
number.
IMPORTANT – USE OF SPARE TYRE
Observe the following warnings before using
the temporary spare wheel:
Adhere to the instructions on the
temporary spare warning label, affixed
to the wheel. This may cause vehicle
instability and/or tyre failure.
Where fitted the temporary-use spare
wheel is FOR TEMPORARY USE ONLY.
Drive with caution while the temporary
spare wheel is fitted. Make sure that
an original size wheel and tyre are
fitted as soon as possible.
Do not fit more than one temporary
spare wheel.
Do not exceed 80 km/h (50 mph) while
the temporary spare wheel is fitted.
The tyre pressure in the temporary
spare wheel should be 4.2 bar (60
psi/420 kPa).
Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) must
be switched on while the temporary
spare wheel is in use.
Traction devices, such as snow chains,
cannot be used with a temporary spare
wheel.
193
Wheel changing

TOWING EYES
The towing eye at the front of the
vehicle is designed for on-road
recovery only.
Do not tow the vehicle on all 4 wheels.
ATTACHING THE FRONT TOWING EYE
The front towing eye is located in the Luggage
compartment, along the right side of the
vehicle's battery. To access the front towing
eye, remove the Luggage compartment left-side
(battery) cover.

1. Pop out the access cover in the front
   bumper.
2. Locate the towing eye through the bumper
   and screw the towing eye counter-clockwise
   into its fixing, until secure.

   Vehicle recovery

TRANSMISSION PARK RELEASE
Make sure that the vehicle is secured
with wheel chocks, apply the Electric
Parking Brake (EPB), or firmly press
the brake pedal. Failure to do so can
result in unexpected movement of the
vehicle, causing serious injury or
death.
When recovering your vehicle, it may be
necessary to manually release the transmission
from the Park (P) position to the Neutral (N)
position. The Transmission park release is
operated by a lever located in the cubby box,
see 65, STORAGE COMPARTMENTS.
To operate the Transmission park release:

1. Remove the left side trim panel.
2. Rotate the Transmission park release
   locking device 90° counter-clockwise.
3. Pull the operating lever until it is latched in
   the vertical position.
   To re-engage the transmission park lock:
   •
   Hold the strap on the operating lever (4),
   and release the latch (5).
   •
   Return the operating lever to the horizontal
   position.
   •
   Rotate the Transmission park release
   locking device 90° clockwise.
   •
   Install the trim panel and close the cubby
   box.
   TRANSPORTING THE VEHICLE
   Only use the lashing points or
   over-wheel lashings. Lashing over the
   body or suspension is not permissible
   as settling of the suspension will cause
   the lashing straps to slacken.
   The recommended method for
   recovery/transportation of the vehicle, is on a
   transporter or trailer designed for that purpose.
   Make sure that transportation is carried out by
   suitably qualified persons, and that the vehicle
   is secured correctly.
   To allow the vehicle to roll freely, the
   transmission will need to be released from Park
   (P) via the use of the Transmission park release.

   Vehicle recovery

If possible, make sure that the
Deployable Rear Spoiler (DRS) is in the
fully stowed position.
196
Vehicle recovery

BEFORE STARTING OR DRIVING
If the vehicle is involved in a collision,
it should be checked by a Dealer/
Authorised repairer, or suitably
qualified personnel, before starting or
driving.
PEDESTRIAN PROTECTION SYSTEM
The bumper includes sensors that detect a
collision with a pedestrian and includes energy
absorbing foam and plastics in its construction,
to reduce leg injuries.
During a pedestrian collision, the sensors
initiate a bonnet deployment system that
releases the bonnet latches and raises the rear
edge of the bonnet by approximately 130 mm
(5.1 inches).
This increases the gap between the bonnet and
the components within the engine compartment
to create a cushion to mitigate injury caused to
the pedestrian.
The bonnet deployment system is active only
when the ignition is on and the vehicle is driven
between the speeds of approximately 20 km/h
(12 mph) and 50 km/h (31 mph).
AFTER DEPLOYMENT OF THE
PEDESTRIAN PROTECTION SYSTEM
Do not attempt to open the bonnet if the
Pedestrian protection system has been
deployed.
The vehicle must be stopped as soon as it is
safe to do so.
The hazard warning lamps will be activated and
can only be switched off by pressing the engine
START/STOP button to turn the engine off and
on again.
A warning message CHECK PEDESTRIAN
SYSTEM will appear in the Message centre and
the vehicle should be transported to the nearest
Dealer/Authorised Repairer. The vehicle must
not be driven when the bonnet has been
deployed.
Note: If the warning message CHECK
PEDESTRIAN SYSTEM appears in the Message
centre when the bonnet has not been deployed,
the vehicle should be taken to the nearest
Dealer/Authorised Repairer immediately. It can
be driven.
If any significant damage occurs to the front
bumper it should be inspected by a
Dealer/Authorised Repairer as soon as possible.
SERVICE DATA RECORDING
Service data recorders in your vehicle are
capable of collecting and storing diagnostic
information about your vehicle. This potentially
includes information about the performance or
status of various systems and modules in the
vehicle, such as engine, throttle, steering, or
brakes.
In order to properly diagnose and service your
vehicle, Jaguar Land Rover Limited service and
repair facilities may access vehicle diagnostic
information through a direct connection to your
vehicle.
197
After a collision

EVENT DATA RECORDING
This vehicle is equipped with an Event Data
Recorder (EDR). The main purpose of an EDR
is to record, in certain crash or near crash-like
situations, such as an airbag deployment or
hitting a road obstacle, data that will assist in
understanding how a vehicle's systems
performed. The EDR is designed to record data
related to vehicle dynamics and safety systems
for a short period of time, typically 30 seconds
or less. The EDR in this vehicle is designed to
record such data as:
•
How various systems in your vehicle were
operating;
•
Whether or not the driver and passenger
safety belts were buckled/fastened;
•
How far (if at all) the driver was depressing
the accelerator and/or brake pedal; and,
•
How fast the vehicle was travelling.
These data can help provide a better
understanding of the circumstances in which
crashes and injuries occur.
Note: EDR data are recorded by your vehicle
only if a non-trivial crash situation occurs; no
data are recorded by the EDR under normal
driving conditions and no personal data (e.g.,
name, gender, age, and crash location) are
recorded. However, other parties, such as law
enforcement, could combine the EDR data with
the type of personally identifying data routinely
acquired during a crash investigation. To read
data recorded by an EDR, special equipment is
required, and access to the vehicle or the EDR
is needed. In addition to the vehicle
manufacturer, other parties, such as law
enforcement, that have the special equipment,
can read the information if they have access to
the vehicle or the EDR.
198
