- Starting the engine
- Automatic speed limiter (ASL)

## Issues Identified

1. **Large file sizes**: Several sections contain the entire manual content instead of just their specific section
2. **Missing sections**: Some sections listed in the table of contents were not found in the actual content
3. **Boundary detection**: The section boundary detection algorithm needs improvement

## Recommendations

1. The properly sized files (under 1MB) can be used as individual section files
2. The oversized files need manual review and correction
3. Missing sections may need to be searched for using different patterns or may not exist in the current manual files
